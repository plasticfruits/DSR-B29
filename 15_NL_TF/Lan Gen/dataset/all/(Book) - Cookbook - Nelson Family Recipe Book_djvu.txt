DEDICATION 



this book is dedicated to annie, minnie, edna, and gladys, 
the first nelson cooks oe my memory thinking oe the 
difficulties they endured every day to put three big 
meals on the table (not to mention afternoon lunch) 
Without electricity, refrigeration, and modern 
plumbing gives me a great appreciation for them all 
and for the conveniences we take for granted. 

We also Want to thank everyone for sending so many 
great recipes. time didn't allow us to test all the 
recipes, but the ones we did try were delicious! we 
have no explanation for the fact that olive's "four 
fruit compote" has 5 fruits or that dolores's "three 
bean casserole" has 4 beans. we are also uncertain as 
to Whether lutefisk or bullhead are suitable 
substitutions in gary's "cioppino." please refer any 
questions to the contributors. 

a special thank you to stacy for all the hours spent 
at the computer typing and editing.

Oatmeal Buns 

Harriet Stanley 



1 cup quick oatmeal 

2 cups boiling water 
1 teaspoon salt 

Vi cup molasses 



2 eggs 

2 packages dry yeast 
Vi cup warm water 
5Vi - 6 cups flour 



1/3 cup shortening 

Mix quick oatmeal and 2 cups boiling water. Add salt, molasses, and shortening. 
(Boiling water will melt the shortening.) Let cool. Then add eggs and dry yeast dissolved 
in Vi cup warm water. Add 5Vi - 6 cups flour. Dough will be soft. Let rise once, then 
form buns. Grease hands as dough is sticky. Let rise again. Bake 20 minutes at 350°. 

I use my Oster bread hooks for these. Grease the top of the hooks so dough won't climb 
them. Easy & fast. 



Makes 2 or 3 Loaves. 

In a large bowl combine yeast, warm water, dark molasses, salt and Vi cup flour. Beat 
until smooth and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes. Add scalded milk, honey or 
molasses, egg, salt, 2 cups flour, shortening and oatmeal. Beat 2 minutes with an electric 
mixer. Gradually add about 3 Vi cups more flour. Form into smooth ball, cover bowl 
and let stand 10 minutes. Knead dough for 5 minutes and shape into 2 or 3 balls. Cover 
with bowl and let rest 10 minutes more. Shape into 2 or 3 loaves and place in 2 standard 
loaf pans or 3 - 8" x 4" pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place 45 to 60 minutes, or until 
doubled in bulk. Bake at 375° for 35-40 minutes.

Whole Wheat Bread 

Harriet Stanley 



¥2 cup warm water 1 cup sugar 

2 teaspoons sugar 4 tablespoons molasses 

2 packages yeast 1 tablespoon salt 

% cup shortening (I use Crisco) 4 cups whole wheat flour 

4 cups warm water 8 cups white bread flour 

Mix ¥2 cup warm water, 2 tsp. sugar, and yeast. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix together 
shortening, 4 cups warm water, 1 cup sugar, molasses, and salt. Add yeast mixture, then 
flours. Work dough well. Put in a warm place to raise ¥2 hour. Knead down. Let dough raise 
another 45 minutes. Knead down. Let raise another 45 minutes. Shape into bread loaves. 
Put into greased (sprayed) bread pans. Should make six small loaves. Don't make large 
loaves. Let raise approx. W2 hours. Bake 350° (preheated oven) for about 40 minutes. 

Overnight Buns 

Olive Jacobson 



4 cups water 2 ¥2 packages of yeast 

2 cups sugar l A cup water 

1 cup oil 1 cup bran 

2 tablespoons salt 1 1 ¥2 cups flour 
4 beaten eggs 

Boil 4 cups water, 2 cups sugar, and 1 cup oil together for 5 minutes. Cool to luke warm. 
Add 2 Tbsp. salt, 4 beaten eggs, 2 ¥2 packages of yeast dissolved in Va cup water. Add 1 
cup bran flakes and 1 1 ¥2 cups flour or enough to make a soft dough. Let raise in a warm 
place. Can be punched down many times. Form buns in evening. Cover with cloth and set 
on counter overnight. Bake at 350° for 10-12 minutes. 



1 usually start this mixture at about 4:00 in the afternoon. It works to start in the morning 
and bake when ready in mid afternoon. Can be used to make caramel or cinnamon rolls. 

Quick No-Knead Rolls 

Kathryn Stanley 

% cup hot water 2 tablespoons sugar 

¥2 cup canned milk 3 ¥2 cups flour 

2 packages yeast 1 teaspoon salt 

Dissolve yeast in water and milk. Add sugar, 1 ¥2 cups flour, and salt; mix until well mixed. 
Add 2 cups flour, mix well. Let set 5 minutes. Shape into rolls and let raise until double. 
Bake at 350° for 15-20 minutes. I use these when I make harvest soup or beef stew. They 
are easy and good, though they are a heavier roll than ones that raise twice. I double this 
recipe, it makes enough to fit Grama Stanley's old baking pan that Mom Stanley gave to me, 
don't know the size, a little longer than a 9 x 13 pan.

Buns 

Olive Jacobson-recipe from her mom, Gladys Nelson 



1 quart milk or 2 c. milk + 2 c. water Vi cup oil 

2 packages yeast 5 cups flour 

1 teaspoon sugar 1 or 2 eggs can be added 

1 cup white sugar 6 cups flour 

2 tablespoons salt 

1 quart of milk or 2 cups milk and 2 cups water warmed to luke warm. Dissolve yeast in 
small amount of warm water and 1 tsp. sugar. Add yeast to milk mixture. Also add 1 cup 
white sugar, salt, and oil. Gradually add 5 cups flour, mixing well. Let mixture raise until 
bubbly. (1 or 2 eggs can be added now.) Add 6 more cups flour. Mix well and knead. Let 
raise until doubled. Punch down dough and let raise again. Buns can then be formed and 
placed on cookie sheets. When doubled in size they should be baked in a 350° to 375° oven 
for 15-17 minutes. This recipe can be used for making caramel rolls also. 

White Bread 

Olive Jacobson-recipe from her mom, Gladys Nelson 

2 cups milk flour

Scald milk and pour over shortening, salt, and 2 T sugar. Add 3 cups water to make mixture 
lukewarm. Beat in flour to make a thick sponge. Add yeast dissolved in Vi cup warm water 
and 1 tsp. sugar. Mix well. Let rest until sponge mixture becomes bubbly, about 20 minutes. 
Add flour and knead until dough is no longer sticky and is firm. (Mom didn't give the amount 
of flour.) Let mixture rest and knead down 2 or 3 times at 20 minute intervals. Turn into large 
greased container. Let raise in warm place until double in size. Knead down again. Divide 
the dough into 5 equal parts, form into loaves and put into greased bread pans. Let raise until 
double in size. Bake at 375° for 20 minutes, then turn heat to 350° and bake 25 minutes 
longer.

Chewy Bread Sticks 

Mueller Family 

1 package yeast 5 - 5 Vi cups flour 

1 Vi cups warm water salt, parmesan cheese, garlic powder or garlic 

1 tablespoon honey salt 



8 



Chewy Bread Sticks, continued 

Dissolve yeast in warm water; add honey. Add flour gradually; mix together and knead 10 
minutes. Heat oven to 200°, then turn off. Let dough rise in oven. Cut into 32 pieces and roll 
into 10 inch ropes. Put on greased cookie sheets, eight to a sheet. Let rise 15 minutes. Brush 
with butter, sprinkle with salt or other seasonings (Our favorites are listed above. You could 
also try onion salt, Italian seasonings, sesame or poppy seeds.) Bake at 400° for 8-12 
minutes. Watch for browning on the bottoms. 

Cheese Garlic Biscuits 

Greta Jacobson 



2 cups Bisquick l A cup margarine 

2/3 cup milk l A teaspoon garlic powder 

Vi cup shredded cheddar cheese 

Heat oven to 450°. Mix Bisquick, milk and cheese until soft dough forms. Beat vigorously 
for 30 seconds. Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes 
until golden brown. Combine margarine and garlic powder. Brush over warm biscuits before 
removing from baking sheet. Serve warm. Makes 10-12 biscuits. 

Flour Tortillas 

Stacy Mueller 

4 cups flour Vi cup shortening 

2 tsp. salt 1 cup lukewarm water (or a little more) 

Blend flour, salt, and shortening with pastry blender or forks until shortening is very well 
distributed. Add lukewarm water and blend well. Turn out onto lightly-floured board and 
knead about 50 strokes. Divide dough into 15 roughly equal sections. Cover with cloth; rest 
for at least 15 minutes. Roll each section of dough into a very thin "circle". (My circles 
usually aren't very circular.) Cook on a moderately hot ungreased skillet, turning once. 



It works well to roll one tortilla while another is cooking, especially if you have a helper. Your 
skillet should be warm enough to cook one side in about one minute. You will need to 
experiment with your cookware and stove to achieve the right combination. I usually have to 
sacrifice the first one as a "test tortilla" and throw it out. I like using our heavy cast iron 
skillet. After cooking one tortilla, put it on a plate and cover with a towel. Pile rolled tortillas 
on top as they wait to cook and they will get soft and more elastic from the warmth. You can 
gently tug them even thinner with your fingers before cooking. 

Wrap and store in refrigerator or freeze. To reheat, pat both sides with water and warm 
directly on the rack in a 300° oven for a few minutes. This will also make the tortillas softer, 
as long as you don't leave them in too long.

Taco Salad 

Stacy Mueller 

1 pound hamburger Shredded cheese (cheddar, colby-jack, etc.) 

Vi envelope taco seasoning 1 medium head lettuce 

1 cup salsa tortilla corn chips 

Brown and drain hamburger. Mix in Vi envelope dry taco seasoning, then add about 1 cup 
salsa. Allow mixture to cool. Shred or cut lettuce into bite-size pieces. Crush chips into 
smaller pieces, reserving enough "perfect" chips to arrange around the edge of your bowl. Mix 
meat mixture, lettuce, and cheese close to serving time. The amount of cheese used can vary 
according to your taste. I reserve 1/3 to V2 cup of the cheese to garnish the top of the salad. 
Just before serving, mix in crushed chips. Tuck the perfect chips in around the edge of the 
bowl and sprinkle top with cheese. 

Notes: You may choose to add other favorite taco ingredients such as olives. (I don't like 
olives.) The cheese should not be finely shredded for best results. This dish is best served 
and eaten all in one sitting as the chips will get soggy and the lettuce may wilt slightly. If you 
won't be able to eat it all at once, only mix together as much as you can eat. If taking salad 
away from home, mix lettuce and chips in once you get to your destination, if possible.

Kumla 

Olive Jacobson 



12 cups ground raw potatoes 
3 cups oatmeal 
4-5 cups flour 



ham 

ham broth 
butter 



Mix potatoes, oatmeal, and flour together with hands, using a lifting motion. Form into balls 
about the size of a potato. Put a chunk of ham into center of ball. Drop into hot ham broth. 
Cook 30-40 minutes. Serve with melted butter 



Dear Joyce and all, 

...You asked how to make Kumla. First you have to have some broth. If you happen to have 
some ham bone, then boil that till the meat comes off. We use picnic ham and that has quite a 
bit of flavor left in it when done. 

Now the Kumla is just raw potatoes ground in a meat grinder. Then add salt to taste and 
flour till it gets stiff enough to handle with your hands. I usually take a little piece of ham and 
put in the center of each Kumla. Then when you get them done put them on the table and eat 
them. Good Luck! You can melt butter to put over them when you eat them... 



Place chicken in 8 x 8 pan. Combine rest of ingredients in small bowl and mix well. Pour over 
chicken. Cover tightly with foil and bake at 375° for 1 hour. Uncover and continue to bake 
for Vi hour or until well browned. Baste every 15 minutes after uncovering. Serve with rice.

Cioppino 

Gary Nelson 



Cioppino is a popular Italian seafood stew that was believed to have originated in San Francicso 
during the "gold rush". It is common to have "cioppino feeds" throughout the Italian community 
in California. If you don't have some of the items, you can substitute with any other seafood 

item. 



Vi pound scallops 

1 pound squid, cleaned and cut up 

1 pound fresh shrimp (peeled and deveined) 

2 whole dungeness crabs (cracked & cleaned) 

2 pounds clams 

1 pound red snapper, sea bass, or halibut 
1 #2 1 /2 (36 oz.) can crushed pear shape 

tomatoes or whole tomatoes 
1 can (14 oz.) clear chicken broth 

3 oz. dry vermouth 

Vi cube butter or margarine (optional) 



8 oz. hot water 

3 oz. oil (olive, corn, or vegetable) 
2 medium onions 

1 small carrot 

5 sprigs parsley 

1 kernel of garlic 

1 round teaspoon Italian herbs 

1 round teaspoon salt 

4 dashes ground black pepper 

2 bay leaves, broken 

1 or 2 whole red chilies 



Soak and scrub clams, let soak in water until ready to use. Mince onions, carrot, parsley, and 
garlic. Brown slowly in heated oil in a 6 quart pot. Stir often. Cut red snapper, sea bass, or 
halibut in pieces about 1 inch wide. Add fish to sauteed items, cook for 5 minutes. Stir. To 
this mixture add crushed or chopped tomatoes and cook for 20 minutes; add canned broth, hot 
water, and bay leaves. Keep heat high enough to keep mixture bubbling and stir. After 10 
minutes add clams and vermouth; cook 5 minutes. Add crab, stir and cook another 5 minutes. 
Add salt, all remaining spices, and shrimp, scallops, and squid. Let cook for 10 more minutes 
and now we are ready to serve on toasted sour dough French bread or plain broiled rice: at this 
point add butter to the sauce, if desired. 

Points you should remember: Cioppino may be prepared early in the day and reheated for 
dinner; this improves the flavor. Sauce can be used for dressing of spaghetti also. Careful 
with the shells. Spicing is always a matter of taste— taste first and add spices you prefer. If too 
thin, use cornstarch (a little) to thicken. Use cuisenart to cut up veggies, garlic, and tomato. 
Cioppino should be somewhat piquant. Serve Cioppino hot from the pot and it should be 
kept warm during the meal. A tossed green salad and red wine completes the meal. Serves 5.

Pizza 

Mueller Family 



1 cup warm water 
1 package yeast 



1 tablespoon sugar 
1 Vi teaspoons salt 



2 tablespoons peanut or olive oil 
2 % - 3 Vi cups flour 
Shane's Pizza Sauce (see next recipe) 
Pizza toppings of your choice 



Measure warm water into a large warm bowl. Sprinkle in yeast; stir until dissolved. Stir in 
sugar, salt, oil, and 1 Vi cups flour; beat until smooth. Add enough flour to make a stiff dough. 
Turn out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in 
a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in a warm place, free from draft, until 
doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. (Oven heated to 200°, then turned off works well.) Punch 
down dough, divide in half. Roll and stretch each into 13-inch rounds. Place in 2 lightly oiled 
12" pizza pans, pressing around edge to form standing rim of dough. Bake at 350° for 10 
minutes. You may want to prick crust with fork before baking. Top immediately and bake 
20 minutes at 400° or cool and store up to 6 days, wrapped tightly, in the refrigerator. 
Recipe may be doubled. Pre-baked pizza crusts, with or without toppings may also be frozen 
for longer periods of time; wrap well. To store pizzas with toppings, wrap with plastic wrap 
first, then aluminum foil. (Tomato in sauce may eat through foil.) A favorite Sunday night 
supper at our house. 



l A teaspoon thyme 

Cook garlic in olive oil for a few minutes. Do not brown. Blend tomatoes slightly in blender 
to break them up. Add tomatoes and all other ingredients to garlic and oil. Simmer, covered, 
over low-medium heat for 2-5 hours, stirring occasionally. If too runny, uncover and reduce 
over higher heat. Enough for 4-5 pizzas. Can also use on pasta.

Matt's recipe above, and those to follow in this section are from last year's 4-H fair, where he 
received a perfect Blue Ribbon score for his cookies and for his display of a Norwegian table 
setting for a holiday meal. He even did a menu up in Norwegian and learned a few phrases for 
his interview with the cooking judges. His Grampa Stanley would have been proud, I know his 
Dad and Mom were.

thin, using a floured pastry cloth and covered, floured rolling pin. Bake on griddle just until 
they start to turn brown, turning once with a long, flat lefse stick. I stack them between clean

etc. 



Fruit Pizza 

Mueller Family & Deb Stanley 

First Layer: 

1 (8 oz.) package cream cheese, 

softened 
1 teaspoon vanilla 
squirt lemon juice (Deb) 
Vi cup powdered sugar (Deb) 
-or- 

Vi cup granulated sugar 
(Mueller) 



Glaze: 

2 Vi tablespoons 
cornstarch 
1 cup pineapple juice 
% cup sugar 
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
(Mueller) 
-or- 

1 tablespoon lemon juice 
(Deb) 



Mix together crust ingredients; pat into pizza pan. Bake at 300° for 10-15 minutes, no 
longer (Mueller) -or- at 350° for 10-12 minutes (Deb). Cool. Beat together cream cheese 
and other first layer ingredients until creamy. When crust has cooled, spread mixture over top 
of crust. Arrange any variety of cut up fruits atop cream cheese layer in an interesting pattern. 
Combine glaze ingredients in saucepan, mixing cornstarch with a small amount of the 
pineapple juice before adding to pan. Heat to a boil; cook until thickened. 

Deb: Pour glaze over fruit while glaze is warm. If using bananas, soak in pineapple juice to 
keep from turning dark. Best if eaten within 5-6 hours. 

Mueller: We like to prepare the glaze before assembling the rest of the pizza. Allow it to cool 
in refrigerator, then spread over pizza when cold. Works best to refrigerate pizza and allow 
layers to "gel" together before slicing.

Coffee Toffee Pie 

(Blum's Restaurant Sacramento and S.F.) 
Gary Nelson— recipe from his daughter, Tricia Diehl 



Pastry Shell: 

Vi package pie crust mix 
l A cup brown sugar, packed 
% cup finely chopped 

walnuts (use blender) 
1 square unsweetened 

chocolate, grated 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 



Filling: 

¥i cup soft butter or margarine 
% cup granulated sugar 
1 square unsweetened chocolate, 
melted and cooled 

1 teaspoon instant coffee 

2 eggs 



Topping: 

2 cups heavy cream 
2 teaspoons instant coffee 
(1 - 1 Vi if you want it 
weaker) 
Vi cup confectioners sugar 
Chocolate curls made with 
sweet cooking chocolate 



103 



Preheat oven to 370°. Make pastry shell: In medium bowl, combine pie crust mix with brown 
sugar, walnuts, and grated chocolate. Add 1 tablespoon water and the vanilla; using fork, mix 
until well blended. (You can add just a tiny bit more water; it's supposed to be a dry crust, but 
not too dry.) Turn into well-greased 9-inch pie plate; press firmly against bottom and side of 
pie plate. (Be sure the pan is greased really well as this tends to stick. Using lots of PAM is 
good.) Bake for 15 minutes. Cool pastry shell in pie plate on wire rack. Meanwhile, make 
filling: In small bowl with electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter until creamy. Gradually 
add sugar, beating until light. Blend in cool melted chocolate and instant coffee. (Note: Be 
sure the chocolate is cool. If it isn't, it changes the texture of the filling. The filling is best if 
it's beaten really well.) To the filling, add 1 egg; beat 5 minutes. Add remaining egg; beat 5 
minutes. Turn filling into cooled baked pie shell. (Be sure pie shell is cool or filling will melt, 
changing its texture.) Refrigerate pie, covered, overnight. Make topping the next day: In large 
bowl, combine cream with 2 teaspoons coffee and sugar. Refrigerate mixture, covered, one 
hour. Beat cream mixture until stiff. Decorate pie with topping using pastry bag with #6, or 
larger decorating tip, if desired. Garnish with chocolate curls. Refrigerate at least two hours. 
Note: If you use freeze-dried coffee, crush it between two spoons to make it into a powder 
before using in recipe, as it will not dissolve otherwise. You can use Dream Whip or Cool 
Whip for the topping, but real cream is better. This pie freezes beautifully either before or 
after adding the topping. If you freeze after adding topping, don't cover with plastic wrap 
until it is completely frozen. To make chocolate curls: Buy sweet cooking chocolate. 
Freeze it. While still frozen, use a carrot peeler (as though you're peeling a carrot) to make 
chocolate curls. If the chocolate is very hard and frozen, they will not be curls, but specs of 
chocolate. As the chocolate begins to warm just a bit, if you peel along the edges, you'll get 
great curls.

Glass Candy 

Stacy Mueller 

2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon anise, lemon, or peppermint 
1 cup water extract 

% cup white syrup food coloring 

Grease a jelly roll pan and set aside. Boil sugar, water, and syrup to 280° or hard ball stage in a 
large saucepan. Add flavoring and appropriate color food coloring, stirring in quickly. Pour 
into greased pan. Spread quickly. Allow mixture to cool at room temperature— it will harden 
quickly. Crack into pieces and remove from pan when hardened. Candy is clear and resembles 
panes of colored glass. This could be used to make lollipops. Be sure to use a larger pan than 
you think you'll need— this bubbles up and isn't something you want all over your stovetop. 
(I speak from experience.) Put a towel under jelly roll pan to protect surface from heat.
