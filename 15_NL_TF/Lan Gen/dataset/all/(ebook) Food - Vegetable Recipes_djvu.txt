Stuffed Peppers 

Stuffed Peppers 

From: Dan Griscom (griscom@media.mit.edu) 

Date: 7 Jul 93 00:00:59 CDT (Wed) 

(from Italian Vegetarian Cooking by Jo Marcangelo) 

(Serves 4) 

4 medium red or green peppers 

2 T olive oil 

1 medium onion, chopped 

1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed 

2 small zucchini, coarsely grated 

1 1/2 c slided mushrooms 

2 T chopped fresh parsely 

2 c fresh wholewheat breadcrumbs 
1/2 c grated Parmesan cheese 
1 egg, beaten 
Salt and pepper 

1) Core peppers by removing stem and then scooping out interior, 
removing all the white pith and seeds. Parboil for 3 minutes in 
boiling water; remove, rinse in cold water and drain. 

2) Heat oil in frying pan, add onion, fry 2 minutes. Add zucchini, fry 
another 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, fry another 1 minute, drain [this is 
to keep the filling from being soupy; you may want to try just 
sauteing until the liquid is gone] . Add rest of ingredients, with salt 
and pepper to taste. Combine thoroughly. 

3) Fill peppers with mixture. Stand upright (cutting a small slice off 
the bottom if necessary) in an ovenproof disk with 2 or 3 T water in 
the bottom. 

4) Bake at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes, or until the peppers are 
tender. Serve hot. 

Ideas: add basil, top with cayenne pepper.

Stuffed Green Peppers 

Stuffed Green Peppers 



From: barrie.lax@synapse.org (Barrie Lax) 
Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 13:10:00 GMT 

Cut the tops off 8 green peppers and remove the seeds . 

Mix a pound of lean minced beef (Hamburger) with a heaping 1/4 cup of 
rice. Add a clove of garlic chopped, a medium onion chopped and salt and 
pepper and blend well. Pack this mixture into each pepper to fill 2/3ds 
and replace the tops. Fit upright in a large saucepan. 

To cover you will need about 2 cups of tomato juice to which add about 4 
tbsp vinegar (wine preferred) along with 3 tbsp of sugar. A little 
chicken stock (about 1 tbsp powdered) would be nice if you have it. Add 
enough water to this to just cover the peppersif you are short. 

Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about an hour until the 
peppers are tender and about 2/3ds of the liquid is absorbed. 

You can sub brown sugar or honey for the sweetener. . .add garlic to the 
juice if you're a fanatic. You can also puree a can of tomatoes and add 
tomato juice to bring you up to quantity if you like a stronger tomato 
note. Adjust the rice to meat mixture to if you like. Hey. . .This is a 
recipe I have made often and can vouch for. If you like it sweeter or 
less meaty that's up to you. The quantities work for me. Obvously the 
size of the peppers will have something to do with the required amount 
of filling. 

This recipe is of Balkan origin and is served both hot and cold as a 
first or main course. As I am here in Ottawa, you may call if you get 
into trouble.

Grilled Portobello Mushrooms 

Grilled Portobello Mushrooms 



From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) 
Date: Mon, 4 Oct 1993 18:44:25 GMT 

Roger Joseph is always asking about Portobello recipes and I tore this 
page out of an American Way magazine on the flight back from Florida 
cause it had a recipe and it reminded me of him. 

Brush the mushroom with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and lots of black 
and red pepper (big mushroom, eh?) . Grill it for 2 and a half minutes 
on each side, and garnish it with a puree of garlic and parsley. 
Serve it with lemon slices on a bed of salad greens with a roasted red 
bell pepper. If you have leftover stems and broken mushrooms bits, 
simmer them for ninety minutes in water with a bay leaf and thyme. 
Use the dark brew to add or enhance a mushroom flavour in sauce.

Marinated Mushrooms 

Marinated Mushrooms 



From: st931530 @ pip.cc.brandeis.edu 
Dat e: Thu, 21 Oct 1993 18:00:54 GMT 

1 cup white wine 

2 tbs . brown sugar 

1/4 cup sliced green onion 

1 ts hot red pepper flakes 
1/2 ts salt 

1/2 ts Oregano leaves 

1/2 cup white wine vinegar 

2 cloves garlic, finely minced 
1/4 cup diced red pepper 

1 lb small fresh mushrooms, trimmed. 
1/4 ts. ground black pepper. 

Combine wine, vinegar, sugar, garlic, green onion, red pepper and red pepper 
flakes in an 8 cup microwaveable casserole. Cover; microwave at high for three 
to five minutes or until mixture is simmering. Add mushrooms. Cover; 
microwave at high 6 to 8 minutes or until mushrooms are tender but not 
mushy. Stir partway through cooking. Stir in salt, oregano, and pepper. 
Let stand, covered, for thirty minutes. Transfer to covered jar or 
container. Can be refrigerated up to one week. 

Actually, it's a good one, even if you can't stand microwave cooking. 
Just watch the mushrooms carefully while they cook. They're also good 
when reheated.

BAKED SCALLOPS AND MUSHROOMS IN GARLIC SAUCE 



Ingredient s : 

3/4 lb scallops 

1/4 cup flour 

1/2 lb mushrooms, stems removed and minced 

3 tblsp olive oil 

1/4 cup white wine 

3 tblsp fine bread crumbs

http://wwwxsxmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/mushrooms/rnush-coll.html (2 of 26) [12/17/1999 12:10:50 PM] 



Mushroom Recipes : COLLECTION 

1 tblsp minced parsely 

2 clove minced or pressed garlic 
pinch of red pepper flakes & salt 



Instructions : 



Preheat oven to 350F. Brush a shallow baking dish with 1 tbs of the 
oil. Bake the ' shroom caps for 10 min. Combine stems, crumbs, onion, 
parsely, red pepper and salt mix together well. Add scallops to the 
baking dish. 

(If you really want to be artistic, plan it out so the scallops are a 
good size to fit into the mushroom caps, and buy the same number of 
each. Then you can stick one scallop in each 'shroom.) 

Add the wine to the baking dish. Sprinkle the minced mixture over all, 
and drizzle the remaining oil over. Bake for 20 more min, or until 
done .

BAKED STUFFED MUSHROOM 



Ingredients : 



8-10 large fresh mushrooms 

1 can of crab meat (drained) 

1-2 tblsp mayonaise 

1/4 cup (or so) shredded swiss cheese 



Instructions : 



Cut the stems of the mushrooms and scoop out the centers. Finely chop 
stems and centers. Combine the crab meat and mayo (as you would for 
tuna salad) . Add whatever seasonings you like (I use "Pinch of Herbs") 
to taste. Add in chopped stems and centers. Add in cheese. Stuff into 
mushroom cups and place under the broiler for 5-7 minutes. 

Note : 



My sister has a "gourmet" recipe with about 97 different ingredients, 
and it IS good, but this is the one dinner guests seem to prefer - they 
usually are the first to disappear!

CRISP SAUTEED MUSHROOMS 



Ingredients : 



1 # large whole fresh mushrooms 

these mushrooms must be absolutely fresh and the caps should 
not be separating from the stems. 

Instructions : 



Brush off mushrooms and slice into 1/4" slices from the top down, 
including the stems . 

With a fine mist spray bottle, mist the mushrooms to just barely dampen. 

Drop into a paper bag or large ziplock bag that contains 1 or 2 cups of 
a/p flour. Stir well or shake very gently. Then, let the mushrooms 
"marinate" for a while in the flour while you prepare to cook them. 

In a large, well seasoned cast-iron skillet or a commercial quality non- 
stick skillet melt 1/2 stick of fresh unsalted butter and -1/4 cup of 
olive oil. Mix the oils well and heat to -300-325 degrees F. 

Drop the mushrooms into a colander to remove excess flour. Drop a few 
at a time into the butter/oil and coat each well. Continue 'til all the 
mushrooms are in the skillet. Turn down the heat to the saute level 
and continue to cook, turning frequently. After a few minutes add salt 
and pepper to taste. 

Continue to cook until the degree of crispness is achieved. 

My neighbor used to cook these for a long time, rendering nearly all the 
moisture out of the mushrooms. The finished product would be the most 
delicate, and crisp mushrooms used as a side vegetable.

GRILLED PORTOBELLA MUSHROOMS WITH MANGO CHUTNEY 



(4 servings) 
Ingredients : 



4 Portobellas 

1 large ripe mango 

1 red bell pepper 

1 jalapeno pepper (optional) 

soy sauce 

vinegar 

1 tsp miso 

1 bunch arugula lettuce 

Instructions : 



Carefully remove stems from mushrooms (use for soup) and clean them 
thoroughly. Marinate in vinegar/mi so/ soy sauce for an hour or so. 

Dice the mango and pepper, chop the jalapeno, and toss with a little 
vinegar . 

Clean the lettuce and separate into single leaves. 

Grill the mushrooms on both sides. When grilling the top, turn the 
mushroom 90 degrees halfway through to get a sguare or diamond 
Crosshatch pattern.

Mushroom Recipes : COLLECTION 

1 lb hot Italian sausage 

1 slice finely chopped onion 

1/2 green pepper, finely diced 

1/4 tsp garlic powder 

1/4 cup dry bread crumbs 

dash of pepper 

1/4 tsp salt 

ca. 1 1/4 cups spaghetti sauce 

40 large mushroom caps 

oil 

mozzarella cheese 



Instructions : 



Cook Italian sausage, onion, green pepper, garlic powder, and a 
handful of mushroom stems, finely chopped, in a skillet, then drain 
fat. (It's best if you put meat mixture into a food processor with 
steel blade at this point to give meat a finer texture. Just process 
for about 5 seconds or less.) Then add bread crumbs, pepper, salt, 
and spaghetti sauce. Coat mushroom caps with oil. Fill mushroom caps 
with meat mixture. Cover with foil and bake at 350 about 20 minutes. 
Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, then broil until cheese is melted and 
mushrooms are tender. (Or loosely cover with wax paper and 
microwave . )

MUSHROOM-BACON PATE - PARTY PATE WITHOUT LIVER 



http://wwwxsxmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/mushrooms/mush-coll.html (11 of 26) [12/17/1999 12:10:51 PM] 



Mushroom Recipes : COLLECTION 

Ingredients : 



2 lbs fresh mushrooms, chopped very fine 

1/2 lb bacon (or more, to taste) 

2/3 cup onion, chopped very fine 

2/3 cup celery, chopped very fine 

8 oz cream cheese, at room temperature 

4 eggs 

1/2 cup parsley, chopped very fine 

2 cups dry bread crumbs 

1 tsp salt 

1 tsp dried rosemary 

1 tsp dried oregano 

1/4 tsp ground black pepper 



(1) Fry the bacon and crumble it as fine as possible. Reserve some of 
the grease. 



(2) Chop the mushrooms, onion, celery, and parsley as fine as possible. 
A food processor works best, but you can do it by hand if need be. 



(3) Saute the onion and celery in the bacon grease until soft, then 
remove from the grease, and drain. 



(4) Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese slightly, and then beat in the 
eggs. Add all other ingredients to the eggs/cheese mixture. Mix 
thoroughly . 

(5) Grease a large loaf pan or two small, line with foil, and then 
grease the foil. Pat the mixture into the loaf pan and cover loosely 
with foil. Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 400 deg. F. 



(6) Let cool completely before serving. 



Notes : 



This pate is actually best when refrigerated before serving. Serve with 
crackers, or with bread cut into shapes with cookie cutters. 

To make this a more elegant buffet dish, garnish the top with a thin 
layer of aspic.

OYSTER FRIED MUSHROOMS 



Ingredients : 

4 oz Oyster mushrooms, rinsed and kept slightly moist 

1 1/2 cup safflower oil for frying 

Flour mix: 



http://wwwxsxmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/mushrooms/mush-coll.html (15 of 26) [12/17/1999 12:10:52 PM] 



Mushroom Recipes : COLLECTION 



1 t sp 
1/2 tsp 
1/4 cup 
pinch 



nori flakes, pulverized in a coffee grinder or blender 
garlic powder 
unbleached flower 
of salt and pepper 



Water mix: 



1/2 tsp 
1/4 tsp 
1/2 cup 



nori flakes 
garlic powder 
water 



Bread crumb mix: 



2 cups 
4 tsp 
1/2 tsp 



fresh bread crumbs (not dried, no crust) 
nori flakes 
garlic powder 



Instructions : 



Thoroughly mix ingredients for each of the three mixes. Heat oil to 350 
(I don't trust my stove, so I got an oil thermometer. He says five mins 
on med heat) in a wok. Dredge mushrooms in flour mix and shake off 
excess. Dip mushrooms into water mix and shake off excess. Dredge 
mushrooms in crumb mix. Fry mushrooms four to five at a time for about 
1 1/2 minutes, being careful that the breading doesn't get beyond 
golden. Drain mushrooms on a towel covered plate. Allow a minute 
between batches for oil to re-heat. Mushrooms may be kept warm in a 250 
oven . 

Serve garnished with fresh lime chunks. 



Although these are deep fried, the mag says they're only 7g fat per 
serving, for what that's worth. 

These are supposed to resemble fried oysters. I obviously wouldn't 
know, but they're really good, and all the Orthodox people I've served 
them to have like them.

QUICK KALE & MUSHROOM SAUTE 



(serves 4 as a side, 2 as an entree) 

1 tblsp olive oil (I use about It, but hey) 

1 tblsp minced garlic 

1 tblsp soy margerine (I omit this) 

8 oz. white mushrooms (to make this really good try oysters or 
chant relies ) 

4 cups kale, tightly packed 
1/4 cup water 

1 tsp tamari 

5 cherry tomatoes, guartered (this time of year I tear up dried 
tomatoes ) 

salt and pepper to taste 

Instructions : 

Heat olive oil on medium in a 4 1/2 g sauce pan. Add garlic and 
margerine (if used) and saute until garlic is lightly browned. Add 
veggies and stir 15-30 seconds, making sure not to burn the garlic. Add 
water, tamari, salt and pepper and cook another 5 minutes, stirring 
often. Add tomatoes and cook another 5 minutes on low. Serve 
immediately . 

Note : 

I assume this dish is meant as a side, but over couscous, millet or 
bulghur it's a guickie meal.

SAUTED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST 



Ingredients : 

2 cups fresh moshrooms 

2 shallots 

2 tblsp fresh chopped parsley 

1 tblsp butter 

1/2 tsp lemon juice (preferably fresh) 
Instructions : 

Clean the mushrooms in cold water (Harlod McGee tells us that they do

Mushroom Recipes : COLLECTION 

not absorb enough water to be worth the fuss of using a mushroom brush. 
I agree. Since they are already something like 95% water, even if they 
absorb a large amount, they will only become ... what - 96%?) 

Cut or pull the stems off of the mushrooms (save them for mushroom soup 
or a duxell) and slice the caps into 3/16 inch slices. 

Finely chop the shallots. If you don't have shallots, use 3 tbsp 
chopped onion and 1 small clove of garlic, chopped, minced, diced, 
pressed, cleavered or otherwise made mushy in your most favorite way. 

Heat a frying/saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and let 
it melt. When the butter is bubbling, add the mushrooms. Saute, 
tossing or stirring until the mushrooms start to brown. If a lot of 
juice comes out of the mushrooms, simply boil it away and keep on. 

As the mushrooms start to brown, add the shallots (or onion and garlic) 
and the chopped parsley. Finish browning the mushrooms. 

Taste the mixture. Sometimes it will improve in flavor with the 
addition of the lemon juice. Sometimes it doesn't seem to be needed. 

Spoon the sauted mushrooms over warm, buttered toast . 

If you want to be fancy, cut the crusts off of the bread before you make 
the toast, cut it diagonally after it is toasted and buttered and call 
it 'toast points. ' Sprinkle a little fresh chopped parsley on top of the 
mushrooms and put a small sprig of parsley on the plate beside. Invite 
the in-laws over and tell them you are learning to cook at the Internet 
Cooking School. 

Another Option: In place of shallots, use about 2 -3 tablespoons of 
finely chopped fresh chives.

Portabella mushrooms (they are Xpensive!) 
large sweet red peppers 
cherry tomatoes 
red onion

Mushroom Recipes : COLLECTION 

1 tsp olive oil 

1 tblsp fresh, coarsely ground black pepper 
Coriander leaves 

Sauce : 



1/2 capful *very good* BALSAMIC VINEGAR (this is the key - get one 

from a specialty store, the supermarket ones are too watered 
down. A good Modena type is good) 

1/4 tsp Hungarian paprika for flavour 

salt to taste 

Algorithm : 



Preparation : 



1. Whisk the sauce ingredients together 

2. Wipe the shrooms with a moist towel and slice long. 

3. Chop the onions along the grooves. 

Cooking : 



1. Place whole peppers and tomatoes on a foil in a preheated oven at 
BROIL. Keep turning them until the peppers are charred. The tomatoes 
will bleed into the foil... don't throw that water. 

2. Remove peppers and make long slices. Remove the core and the seeds. 

3. Mix the cherry tomatoes and the fluid they exude, into the sauce. 
Mix well until the tomatoes are crushed into the sauce. 

4. Pour the oil in a heated skillet. Saute onions and 'shrooms. 
Sprinkle with black pepper. Add half the sauce and saute for a few mts. 
more . 

Serving : 



1. Arrange the shrooms on a plate. Place the red peppers around it. 
Pour the extra sauce on the circumference. Sprinkle coriander leaves. 

2. Serve with brown rice or rye bread. 
Note : 



This is a mildly hot recipe for my favourite ' shroom which I have 
perfected over months. Generally, I dislike food that has no heat... its 
just too unappetising for me. But this 'shroom is so flavourful that a 
minimum of spicing is desired. So I have struck a balance between what

excessive) . Chop the mushroom stems into very small bits. Coat the 
outer poriton of the caps with olive oil. Finely chop onion, garlic, 
and tomato. Fry onion and garlic in olive oil (just a little bit), 
until soft. Add mushroom bits, tomato, salt and pepper to taste. Fry 
until mushroom bits start to soften. Place mixture in mushroom caps, 
and fry or grill until caps soften. (I prefer grilling, but its a lot 
more work) . Serve. I find that steak is an excellent complement to 
this dish.

Gratin of Potatoes Girardet 



From: r . gagnaux@chnet . ch (Rene Gagnaux) 
Date: Sat, 18 Sep 1993 12:00:00 +0200 

Categories: Gratin 
Servings : 4 

400 g Floury potatoes (14 oz) 20 g Unsalted butter (3/4 oz) 

1 x Small clove of garlic Salt, pepper, cayenne and 

200 ml Milk (scant 1/2 pint) - nutmeg 

100 ml Double cream (scant 1/4 pint 

IMPORTANT: The gratin is best if it is given gentle, slow cooking 

Peel the potatoes and cut them into thin slices about 3 mm (1/8 in) thick. 
ABOVE ALL, DO NOT WASH THEM. 

Peel and chop the clove of garlic very finely and mix it with the sclices 
of potato. 

Put the potatoes into a saucepan with just enough milk to cover them. 
Season with salt, pepper, cayenne and a few gratings of nutmeg. 

Put the pan over a fairly high heat and cook the potatoes for 4-5 minutes, 
or until you can see that the milk has blended and thickened a little with 
the starch given out by the potatoes. At this point, add half the cream 
and just bring the pan to the boil. Take it off the stove and taste for 
seasoning . 

Butter a gratin dish. This should be big enough to take the potatoes in a 
layer NOT MORE THAN 2 cm (3/4 in) THICK. Arrange the potatoes in the dish 
with their creamy milk. Add the rest of the cream and mix it in well. 
Sprinkle a few flakes of butter on the surface. 

Pre-heat the oven to 160 oC/320 oF . Bake the gratin at the bottom of the 
oven for a good 1 1/2 hours. 

Excellent with any plainly cooked poultry or roast meat.

Marjoram Potato Casserole 

Marjoram Potato Casserole 

From: cschnell@iiasa.ac.at (Carey SCHNELL) 
Date: Tue, 3 Aug 1993 07:41:31 GMT 

750 g potatoes 
salt 

bunch of fresh marjoram (dried otherwise) 

250g cream 

2 egg yolks 

freshly ground pepper 

40 g butter 

75g ham 

(If I want this as a main meal, then I use minced meat and prepare 

it the same way I would for Lasagna (ie spicy and rich) 

I then just alternate the layers of meat mix and the potato recipe.) 



- Wash, peel and slice the potatoes thinly. 

- In lightly salted, rolling boiling water, cook for 5 mins . 
(sorry about the sentence stucture- I'm translating this from German- 
this is an "authentic" Austrian recipe...) 

- Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a sieve. 

- Take the Marjoram from the stalks, and chop finely. 

- Mix salt, pepper and marjoram with the egg yolks and cream. 
Grease a casserole dish, and place half the potatoes in the form. 

- Chop the ham finely, and spread half over the potatoes. 

- Sprinkle s and p over the layers . 

Place the rest of the potatoes in the dish, and then pour the 
egg mix over the top. Sprinkle with ham, and dot the top with the remainder 
of the butter used for greasing the dish. 

Cook on 250degrees Celcius (er- Farenheit, -375) for 30-40 mins, or 
until golden on top. 

Serve with a green salad dressed with a marjoram/vinegar combination. 
Note : 

I have made this with basil instead of marjoram (and the same with the 
salad) and it was wonderful. To cut down the fat content, I have used 
a mustard sauce with chucks of low fat cheese melted into it- also 
great !

ARMENIAN POTATOES 



Ingredient s : 



750 g old potatoes, peeled thinly and diced 

3 tblsp tomato paste (I used one with added herbs and onion) 
1/4 cup water 

4 cloves garlic, very finely chopped 
1 tsp salt 

1/2 tsp paprika 

1/4 cup oil (I used a bit less and used some of my own herbed olive oil) 

1 cup finely chopped parsley 



Instructions : 



Place the whole lot in a casserole dish and bake at around 375F for 45 
minutes or until the potatoes are tender. 

I cooked it for somewhat longer than this because the males in the 
family vanished to watch some field hockey later afternoon and were a 
bit delayed coming home. As long as you don't use mush spuds, I would 
say this dish is fairly forgiving of being left to fend for itself.

EIFELER SCHOLES 



Ingredients : 

1.5 kg potatoes 

3 rolls 

50 g durchwachsener Speck (that is ham that is "red and white" red 

from the meat - and white from the fat) It is here abit smoked 
1 little onion 

4 eggs 
salt 
pepper 

Instructions : 

Grate the potatoes and onion. Cut the ham into little cubes and 
melt/bake it out. Put the rolls into water, so that they soak water and 
press them out. Mix that all together (potatoes, ham and the mashed 
rolls) with the eggs. 

Put the dough in a form (like the one you use for lasagne for example) , 
which is greased with butter, and put it for 90 minutes into the oven 
(180 Celsius) untill it is "golden" on the top. 

Note : 



The eifel is an area in Germany (where the famous Nuerburg Ring is, 
something like hmmm the Hockenheim Ring or Daytona ( ;-) ), where 
car and motorbikes races are) between Luxemburg, Belgium, Holland 
and the rhine area (Cologne, Bonn) .

HASH BROWNS 



This is what I usally make and my S.O. loves it. It tastes good 
anytime of the day! I nuke (boil if you have time) some potatoes cut 
into fat chunks (I always use the red ones) and add sliced mushrooms, 
red pepper, green pepper, red onions and if you want you could also add 
bacon, hot salsa, chopped tomatoes, sausage, chorizo, hot peppers, 

I then sautee this mess for awhile until soft and tender then I throw in 
some fresh basil, parsley, cilantro and oregano from my garden. It is 
really good and easy to make! Also very filling! I like to put either 
salsa or ketchup on top of mine, my S.O. covers his with Blue cheese 
dressing. Enjoy! Kathy

the potatos)

Potato Recipes : COLLECTION 



Peel the potatoes (this is also optional - I usually am lazy and leave 
the peel on) . 

Grate the patatoes. 

Thorouhly wash the grated potato in cold water. This is a key step. It 
washes out much of the starch and will allow them to cook crispier. 
Squeeze the water out of the potato in a paper or cloth towel. Melt the 
fat in hot frying pan (black cast iron works best) or add the peanut 
oil. The potato will soak up a lot of oil, but be careful, they can 
taste oily if you add too much. 

Slowly add the grated potatos - be careful of splattering the oil since they 
are wet . 

You can leave them in place and then flip when one side is golden brown. 
I prefer to stir them frequently so all the little pieces brown. If you 
do this, when you are about half done, you can add the bacon and onions 
(any earlier and they tend to burn - esp the onion) . If you do not stir 
the potatos, mix the sliced onion and pre-cooked bacon in with the 
potatoes ahead of time (bacon this way must be pre-cooked to ensure it 
all is cooked. 

Keep stirring every two minutes or so until they reaceh your desired 
browness. Near the very end, you can grate some cheese over the 
potatos . 

Method 2: 



Use left over baked potato - or bake one for 7 minutes in the 
micro-wave. Do all the above steps except wash the potato

MAJORAM POTATO CASSEROLE 



Ingredient s : 



750 g potatoes 

250 g cream (you can use a mix of yoghurt and sour cream to lower 

the fat content) 
2 egg yolks 

40 g butter 
75g ham 

bunch of fresh marjoram (dried otherwise) 

freshly ground pepper 

salt 



If I want this as a main meal, then I use minced meat and prepare it the 
same way I would for Lasagna (ie spicy and rich - you don't need to tell 
The Parents this little secret though) I then just alternate the layers 
of meat mix and the potato recipe.

Instructions : 



Wash, peel and slice the potatoes thinly. 

In lightly salted, rolling boiling water, cook for 5 mins . (sorry about 
the sentence stucture- I'm translating this from German- this is an 
authentic Austrian recipe...) 

Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a sieve. 

Take the Marjoram from the stalks, and chop finely. Mix salt, pepper 
and marjoram with the egg yolks and cream. 

Grease a casserole dish, and place half the potatoes in the form. Chop 
the ham finely, and spread half over the potatoes. Sprinkle salt and 
pepper over the layers . 

Place the rest of the potatoes in the dish, and then pour the egg mix 
over the top. Sprinkle with ham, and dot the top with the remainder of 
the butter used for greasing the dish. 

Cook on 250 degrees Celcius (er- Farenheit, -375) for 30-40 mins, or 
until golden on top. 

If you choose this one, still serve with a green salad.

Preheat over to 350. 



Put potatoes, onions, nuts, and bread through a food processor so it is 
all ground up, like meat loaf. Mix these ingredients well, then add the 
rest of the ingredients. 

Put in well-greased loaf pan and bake until 1 hour or until firm. 
Stays firm when cold, so it is very good for meatloaf sandwiches.

PAPAS A LA HUNCAINA, MAS MENO 



Ingredients : 

1 lb small red potatoes, or any waxy-skinned variety cut in half or 

into pieces no larger than 2" in any direction 
Juice of 1/2 lime 

2 tsp achiote seeds, ground and sifted as described 
2 shallots, coarsely chopped 

1/4 tsp dried thyme 

1 habanero chile, ripe, roasted, peeled and chopped 

2 tblsp or so olive oil 
3-4 oz goat cheese 

Instructions : 



Boil potatoes until done but still firm. Mix all other ingredients 
except goat cheese in a blender. Drain potatoes, stir in goat cheese, 
then pour sauce over and mix. Serve immediately, preferably with either 
bread or tortillas to wipe up the last of the sauce. (Kim and I almost 
fought over it...) 

Note : 



This is *quite* hot, but awfully good. The achiote, lime juice, and 
habanero work very nicely together, and the potatoes offset a lot of the 
fire. We served it with something simple like either a roasted chicken 
or shark in lime juice (see yesterday's recipe for tiburon a la 
margarita) .

POTATOES AU G RAT IN 



Ingredient s : 



4 tblsp butter 

3 tblsp all-purpose flour 

2 tsp salt 

1 tsp black pepper 

2 cups milk 

5 large potatoes, peeled and sliced into medium-thin slices 
2 onions, peeled and chopped 



1-1/2 to 2 lbs * sharp cheddar cheese, cubed or sliced 
Instructions : 



In a medium saucepan, melt butter and add flour, salt and pepper. Pour 
in the milk and stir freguently till thickened. Set aside. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a large casserole (3-1/2 to 
5 guart ) . 

Layer 1/4 of the potatoes, 1/4 of the onion, 1/4 of the cheese and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat the next layer. Then, on top of 
the second layer, pour half the white sauce over (be a little reserved 
' cuz you want the majority of the white sauce on top of the finished 
casserole) . Then, again, repeat the next layer with potatoes, cheese, 
onion, salt and pepper. Repeat the final layer with same. Pour the 
remaining white sauce over the top, making sure you cover all . Sprinkle 
the final product with salt and pepper. 

Cover and bake 1 hour. Then, remove the cover and bake for another 
hour. Don't worry if it gets a little dark on top. 

For leftovers, I put some of the casserole in a microwaveable dish. 
Pour a little milk over and stir. Zap in the microwave on high until 
heated through! 

* I prefer Tillamook medium sharp Cheddar cheese but I don't know what 
kind of cheese you can get where you are, but whatevr you do, DON'T use 
American or Velveeta! :)

SLICED AND SPICY POTATIES 



Ingredients + Instructions: 



Enough potatoes for 4 persons, and then 2 for luck. Scrub but don't 
peel. Slice thickly, approx half inch thick. Lay onto the oven tray, 
but make sure both sides have a little grease on them otherwise they 
will stick to the tray. You may need to add a little more oil (I use 
chili oil, but that may be a little hot for The Parents) . 

Keep an eye on these little suckers, as they will cook pretty quickly. 
The idea is that they will bubble up towards the end, and you will need 
to turn them over to get them all toasty on the other side as well. 
Sprinkle the potatoes and the chicken (make sure you turn them over at 
some stage in the cooking as well, but they should end up skin side up 
to make sure the skin doesn't get soggy) with the spice mix throughout 
the cooking time, to get the flavour through. 

In the meantime, prepare a simple tossed salad with a simple dressing so 
as not to compete with the flavour of the chook. Serve with the salad 
and a good Turkish bread (one of the ones that you rip apart, or a 
crusty one if you want something a little more elegant) .

SWEET POTATOES WITH GRAPEFRUIT 



Ingredients : 

1 3/4 lb sweet potatoes 

1 large grapefruit 

3 tblsp unsalted butter 

1/3 cup (firmly packed) light brown sugar 



http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/potato/pot-coll.html (18 of 20) [12/17/1999 12:11:26 PM] 



Potato Recipes : COLLECTION 

1/4 tsp salt 

2 eggs, well beaten 

Instructions : 



Preheat oven to 375F. Put the potatoes, unpeeled, in a large saucepan 
and cover with water. With a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, peel the 
yellow zest from the grapefruit and put it in with the potatoes. Bring 
to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the sweet potatoes are just 
fork-tender, about 20 minutes. 

Meanwhile, with a long-pronged fork or tongs, dip the grapefruit into 
the boiling potato water and blanch, turning constantly, for 30 seconds. 
Rinse the grapefruit briefly under cold running water to cool and peel 
off the white pith. Section the grapefruit and peel off the membranes 
over a bowl to catch the juice. Reserve all the juice and pulp; discard 
any seeds . 

When the sweet potatoes are done, drain and let cool; discard the 
grapefruit zest. Peel the potatoes and put them into a food processor 
along with the grapefruit pulp and juice, the butter, brown sugar and 
salt. Puree until smooth. Add the eggs and mix to blend. 

Pour the sweet potato mixture into a well-buttered, 6-cup souffle dish. 
Place in a pan of hot water and bake for 45 minutes, or until the center

Potato Recipes : COLLECTION 

salt 

Instructions : 



Boil the potatoes for 5-7 minutes in salted water. Cook until tender, 
then remove with a strainer. 

Wash well and then chop the greens, removing tough stems. Cook the 
greens until done in the potato water. Cook the tougher greens longer. 

Warm the olive oil in a wide pan and add the chilies. When oil is hot, 
add potatoes, stir well and cook for 1 min. or so. Add greens, 
tomatoes, garlic. Continue cooking for 5 minutes or so, breaking up the 
potatoes and working everything together. It becomes somewhat muddled, 
but delicious. Taste for salt, add pepper and some cheese, and serve 
with a bit of extra-virgin olive oil threaded over the top.

Rosti 

Rosti 



From: jtaylor@pietro.pichem.adelaide.edu.au (Jo Taylor) 
Date: 30 Sep 1993 17:39:13 +0930 

This is in reply to a request which was posted earlier asking for 
a rosti recipe from the interlaken district of Switzerland. I'm not 
sure if this is what Michael was looking for but the recipe is easy, 
tastes great and is something different you can do with the humble old 
potato . 

Firstly, you will need about four medium to large potatoes (this is 
for four people) . Peel them and boil them for ten minutes (the time 
may vary depending on the size of the potatoes, however the potatoes 
should remain hard. It's important not to boil them for too long.) 
Allow the potatoes to cool slightly then wrap in plastic wrap and 
refridgerate for at least one hour. Grate the potatoes (they should be 
quite sticky) add salt to taste then pat into a flat round and fry in 
butter for about 5-10 minutes on each side or until they are golden 
brown. Slice into wedges and serve. 

I find that if you make them into smaller individual patties they are 
easier to turn when cooking and look nicer when served.

50g/2oz parsley 

1 tablespoon chopped chervil 

1 tablespoon chopped tarragon 

1 tablespoon chopped dill 
175g/6oz ricotta cheese 
25g/loz butter 

75g/3oz Parmesan cheese, grated 
sea salt 

freshly ground black pepper 

2 eggs, beaten 

3 tablespoons plain flour, sifted

1/2 lb spinach 

1/4 lb sorrel 

1 bunch American cress 

1 1/2 cups parsley 

1 tablespoon chopped chervil 

1 tablespoon chopped tarragon 

1 tablespoon chopped dill 
2/3 cup ricotta cheese 

2 tablespoons butter 

3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
coarse salt 

freshly ground black pepper 

2 eggs, beaten 

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, sifted 



Wash and drain the spinach, sorrel, watercress and parsley. Place in a 
large pan of boiling water and boil for 4 minutes; drain. When cool enough 
to handle, press out as much moisture as possible and chop finely. Add the 
remaining herbs and place in a saucepan over low heat for several minutes, 
stirring, to dry out. 

Beat the ricotta cheese to a smooth consistency and add to the puree with 
the butter, 25g/loz/l/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese and salt and pepper to 
taste. Take the pan off the heat and stir in the eggs and flour. Beat 
until smooth. Pour into a cool shallow dish and leave in the refrigerator 
overnight . 

Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to a boil . Form the green mixture 
into egg-shaped gnocchi, using 2 teaspoons, and roll them very lightly on a 
floured board. Drp them in batches in the pan, but do not crowd them. 

When they float to the surface, after 4 to 5 minutes, lift them out with a 
slotted spoon and drain. Test one to make sure they are cooked through, 
then transfer to a warmed serving dish. 

Sprinkle the gnocchi with a little Parmesan cheese; serve the remaining 
cheese separately. Serve with melted butter if you like.

Mike's Black Bean and Broccoli 

Mike's Black Bean and Broccoli 

From: isr@mailbox.syr.edu (Michael S. Schechter - ISR group account) 
Date: Tue, 3 Aug 93 15:59:53 EDT 

In response to asking for recipes, I'm posting the ones I've 
discovered in the last couple weeks. (I AWLAYS experiment, I 
read the group just for letting ideas sift thru my head) 

so, here's "Mike's Black Bean and Broccoli" 

Note this fills a 12" skillet, you may want to make less. 

Crush together into bowl, mix into paste: 

1/2 can (15oz) black bean 

7 clove garlic, crushed 

1 T ginger, minced, crushed 

1 T soy paste 

1 oz soy sauce 

1 T korean red pepper 

9 African Red Devil chilies, crushed 
1 T Laxmi brand chili powder (indian) 
water to thin 

The differences in peppers are subtle, if you don't have access to 

a multitude of peppers, use 1 T paprika, 1 T red pepper, 5 HOT dried peppers 

Cook in large skillet: 

1 1/2 lb chicken or tofu 
1 t oil. 

At 1/3 done point, add 1 oz oriental vermicelli. 

When vermiceeli is a little browned, add spice paste and water as needed. 
When all done, flavored to taste, add: 

1 1/2 bunch broccoli, chopped 

2 green peppers, chopped 

Heat just till veggies are hot. 
Serve with kirn chee on side.

sheets nori, pretoasted (oriental or natural food market) 

umeboshi plum paste 

rice vinegar 

clove garlic, smashed 

slice ginger, smashed or grated 

soy sauce 

carrots 

eggs 

scallions 
cooked rice 
oil 



Prepare ingredients: Heat oil in small skillet (about 20 cm diameter) on 
med. high. Slice carrots *lengthwise* into pieces about 0.5 cm diameter. 

Saute carrots, garlic, and ginger until carrots are just slightly 
cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove from pan. Stir together eggs and soy 
sauce. Add to pan, and cook until eggs are set. Do not disturb eggs 
while cooking, except to turn once. You should end up with an 
"omelette", fairly dry. When eggs are set and moderately firm, remove 
from pan. Cut into strips about 0.5 cm wide. Mix vinegar and plum paste 
into cooked, cooled rice. 

Assemble nori rolls: Lay out a sheet of nori with the "rough" side 
toward you. Spread 1/4 of the rice across nori, leaving about 2 cm space 
on the far end and 1 cm space on the close end. Go all the way to the 
sides. Make an indentation in the rice about 2 cm from the close end. 
Lay 1/4 of the other ingredients in the indentation: carrots, eggs, and 1 
scallion. Now roll up, beginning by folding over the 1 cm flap of nori 
closest to you, then rolling up from the folded edge. You want the roll 
to be nice and firm, so try to keep it tight as you go. To seal, run a 
slightly wet finger over the edge where the seam is. Place seam-side 
down. Slice crosswise into pieces 4-8 cm long (your preference) . The 
orange carrot, yellow egg, and green scallion make a lovely center 
against the white (or brown) rice. Serve with soy and pickled ginger. 

Notes: sticky rice works the best, but any kind will do. Use brown rice 
for the best nutritional value.

Nori Rolls (vegetarian sushi) 



Variations: Once you have the basic method down, vary the center 
ingredients as you wish. This is my favorite combination, but other 
ideas are tofu strips, other types of cooked vegetables, fresh spices 
(strips of fresh dill, for example), etc.

RED BEANS WITH PECANS AND SAFFRON OVER WHOLE WHEAT SPAGHETTI 

1 small can red beans 

pecan halves 

dry red wine 

saffron 

oregano 

thyme 

black pepper 
olive oil 
garlic 

Drain a small can of red beans. (Pintos may substitute.) Save the juice 
in a small bowl and add a small amount of crumbled saffron to it so it 
marinates. Not too much, you want the taste to be subtle, not dominant. 

Saute garlic in olive oil for a little bit, along with pecan halves and 
some crushed red chiles. 

Add the drained beans and cook so the flavors mingle. Add quite a bit of 
oregano and less thyme and a pinch of black pepper. Add some dry red wine, 
don't be too shy. 

Add in the saffron-flavored bean liquid and cook a few more minutes. The 
consistency should be thin but not like soup. 

Serve over whole wheat spaghetti. Brown rice might also work.

salt to taste 
2 c. water 

2 28 oz. cans tomatos 
6 oz . can tomato paste 
2 cans . kidney beans 

Instructions 

Saute first five ingredients in oil until limp. Add tofu and saute 
until browned. Mix the spices together in a bowl and sprinkle into 
the pot. Mix thoroughly. Add water, tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir. 
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring 
occasionally. If desired, at this point, add the kidney beans. 
Taste and correct seasoning. The addition of 1 tsp. to 1 T. of 
cayenne pepper can make this gradually more spicy. As the recipe 
reads, itUs fairly tame. NOTE: The ground chilis are NOT chili powder. 
Most chili powder is made up of a combination of chilis, oregano, 
cumin, salt and garlic. If chili powder is all you can find, then 
you will have to readjust the cumin and oregano amounts.

Vegetarian Gravy

If you have a good veggie base around, it is easy. I make one about every 
2 weeks. Unfortunately, I don't do milk any more so this recipe is a thing 
of the past for me, but it used to hit the spot. 

to make 2 cups or so. . . 

Saute small onions and 4-5 mushrooms and 1 clove garlic in butter (or just 
heat up some butter if you want it plain.. I like onions) 

When they soft, add about 2 tblsp flour and mix it around until it is 
absorbed . 

Pour on 1-1.5 cups veggie broth and stir. When that starts to warm up, 
pour a cup or less of cream or milk in and stir. Let boil stirring alot 
in the beginning to keep it from lumping. and voila! The amount of flour 
is kinda if-y. I like it thick, and usually end up adding more flour later 
on in the process to make it thicker. 

Peace,

Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves (Dolmas) 

Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves (Dolmas) 



From: dpc47 8 52@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Daniel Paul Checkman) 
Date: 14 Sep 1993 21:40:10 GMT 
Cross-indexed Vegetarian, Greek 

How about this Dolma recipe from _Try 'em. . . You'll Like 'em. . . Even More_, 
which is a cookbook published by Congregation Beth David Sisterhood. Anyhow, 
Mrs. Leitner has a recipe with no meat in it. This is being printed without 
permission, but I at know her and I'm sure she'd be honored to have her 
recipe posted here : 

0.5 c. veggie oil 

4 medium onions (chopped) 

1 c. uncooked rice 

1 c. parsley (minced) 

0.5 c . raisins 

0.5 c. tomato sauce 

1 c. water 

0.75 tsp. allspice 
0.5 tsp. pepper 
Grape leaves 

2 tsp. salt (or less/ to taste) 

Saute onions in the oil until browned. Add rice and cook on a low 
heat for 20 minutes (covered), stirring occasionally. Add all other 
ingredients (except grape leaves, of course) and cook for 5 minutes. When it 
has cooled a little, use approx. 1 tsp. of filling per grape leaf and roll up, 
as for a burrito. The filling should be totally enclosed. To cook the "raw" 
dolmas, line a large pot with grape leaves and arrange the dolmas in the pot. 
Put a plate on top to keep them from floating up, and cover with water. 
Simmer for about 1 hour. 

Mrs . Leitner goes on to mention that these can be served hot (with or without 
yogurt) or as a cold appetizer. Basically it's the same recipe as for stuffed 
cabbage, except there is no meat or cabbage. I've also tried dolmas elsewhere 
that leave out the raisins and tomato sauce, and sometimes add pine nuts to 

the mixture, but they are usually a bit more bland. 
Good Luck,

Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves 

Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves 

From: Gretchen Miller grm+@andrew . emu . edu 
Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1993 14:32:36 -0400 

I just made these the other night, and they were quite good. I started 
with this recipe, from The Old World Kitchen, and basically eyeballed 
and fiddled until I had something I liked. I'll note the recipe and 
then note my changes: 

grape leaves, fresh or bottled 
1 cup uncooked white rice 
1/4 cup olive oil 
1/2 lb onion, minced 
1/2 cup raisans 

(1 tsp coriander, which was my addition to this) 
juice of 2 lemons 

Heat half the olive oil, fry onions until soft, add rice and stir to 
coat. Pour on a glass of water, add raisans and cook until all water is 
absorbed. Roll into grape leaves, place grape leaves, seam side down, 
in a baking dish (close together) , add more water, oil and lemon juice 
and bake at 300F for 1 hour. 

Now, my changes : 

I use the bottled grape leaves, because I like the extra tang from the 
pickling juice. I also used green onions (both white and green) instead 
of regular onion, and used more of just about everything. 

Heat olive oil, fry onions until soft, add rice and stir to coat. Pour 
on a glass of water, add raisans and coriander. As water is absorbed, 
add more until the rice is firm but no longer crunchy. (I've found that 
the one glass method tends to produce crunchy/undercooked rice) . Roll 
mixture into grape leaves (notes on rolling below) and pack like the 
bottom layer of a can of sardines (or like the 12 bunnies in the bed...) 
with the seam side down. When the pan is full, add one or two fingers 
of water (i.e. pour in water so the height of the water on the side of 
the pan is the width of one or two fingers) Squirt lots of lemon juice 
on the little suckers. Cover, put in 300F over and bake for 1 hour. 
The tops may get a little dry during cooking, but will remoisten when 
stored in the ref rigorator .

Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves 

Note on rolling grapeleaves: 

Place your grape leaf flat, stem end away from you, vein side up. Place 
about a tablespoon or so of mixture a tiny bit closer to you than the 
point where the two side leaves branch off. Fold the bottom over the 
stuffing toward you. Fold the side leaves in toward the center. The 
stuffing should now be surrounded on at least 3 sides. Roll toward you 
until you have a little cigar shaped packet. 

Enjoy !

This is my aunts recipe. I think it's heavenly: 

3 C. rice, soaked in boiling water and salt for lhr. 

1/2 C. olive oil 

Juice of one large lemon 

1 bunch green onions, chopped 

1 bunch parsley, minced 

1 large, firm tomato, choppped 

1 tsp. dried mint (optional) 

salt and pepper to taste 

Thoroughly rince rice and drain well. Mix the rice and all the above 
ingredients in a bowl. If you are using fresh grape leaves blanch 
in boiling water for a minute. Stuff and cook. You could use torn 
grape leaves or slices of tomato to line the bottom of the pan so 
that the bottom layer of stuffed grape leaves won't scorch.

1/2 cup sesame seeds 

1/2 cup wheat germ 

1/3 cup chopped parsley 

2 tbl chopped dill 

3 tbl tahini (sesame seed paste) 

1 1/4 cups cooked chickpeas (if using canned garbanzo beans, make sure they're 

we 11 -drained) 
3 tbl tamari 
3 tbl lemon juice 
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 
1/2 tsp salt 

3/4 tsp freshly ground pepper 

3/4 tsp ground cumin 

oil for rubbing burgers and grill 

Put bulgur in a bowl of hot water, soak for 10 minutes or until 
tender, drain well. 

Heat oil in a skilled, saute mushrooms, carrots, onions, garlic for 15 mins . 

Grind walnuts and sunflower seeds, put into a bowl, add sesame seeds, 
bulgur, and wheat germ. 

Mix sauteed vegetables with parsley, dill, tahini, chickpeas, tamari, lemon 
juice, cayenne, salt, pepper, and cumin until blended (small lumps ok) . Add

in the refrigerator) . 

Shape into patties, pat with oil, cook 4 minutes on each side, flip 
carefully with a Wide spatula to keep from falling apart. Serve on toasted

these juccini variations are all authentically greek (or turkish, or lebanese- at any rate, they're from our 
corner of the mediterranean! !) 

the first one is one of my favourites, all veggo, lots of oil, served at room temperature or cold- perfect 
summer dish 

Contents 

• Briami 

• Lathera 

• Fried Zuchinni 

Briami 



5-6 large zuccini, cut in 1 in. cubes 
3-4 medium potatoes, cut in similar cubes 

2 eggplants (the purple, zuccini look-alike) cut in cubes 

1 can stewed tomatoes 

3-4 cloves garlic crushed 

1 onion , cut in large chunks 

a couple of bay-leaves 

1/2 cup oil (preferably olive, but anny kind will do) 
a dash of nutmeg, thyme 
salt and pepper 

arrange (really throw in!) all the ingredients in your baking pan, and 
give them a good mix (another name for this dish is TOURLOU, i.e. 
mix-mix) 

and bake for about 1 hour at a medium heat oven 
keep adding a touch of water to keep the stuff from frying 
allow to cool before eating- 
serve with a generous amount of oil and juices 
and with some bread to clean up the plate ! 



Lathera (translates to TH E OILY DISH)

Evangelos Doussis' Zuchinni Collection 



the following is a variation of the above theme, different presentation 
the veggoes come out crispier this way 

4-5 medium size zuccini, cut in 1/4 in. disks 
3-4 medium potatoes, cut in 1/4 in. disks 
1-2 medium onions, sliced in thick rings 
1-2 medium tomatoes, sliced in 1/4 in. disks 
6-7 cloves garlic, peeled and whole 
1/2 cup olive oil (or any other oil) 
1/2 cup chopped parsley 
salt and pepper 

2 tblspoons oregano (save for the end!) 

arrange in loose layers in the baking tray, try and keep the onion 
rings at the bottom of the pan, they get nice and crispy, and the 
tomatoes go at the top of the assembly, to let the juices drain down 
onto the veggoes 

bake for about 1 hour, at medium oven 

the oregano should be added a few minutes before taking the tray out 
of the oven- burnt oregano loses its flavour, and has a bitter taste 
allow to cool before eating 

Fried Zuchinni 



for the batter: 
1 egg (beaten) 
1/3 cup milk 
1 cup flour 
salt, pepper, 
water if needed 

stir batter ingredients until batter is smooth- if it's too thick add 
water- otherwise add flour- i get it to where it kinda sticks to the 
fork 



for the juccini 

5-6 juccini- cut either steak fries style, or in 1/4 in. disks 
dip juccini in batter 

deep-fry in preheated oil (i set the stove on medium high) until

each Zuke only 3/4 full and place the top on it (I taper the top with a 
knife so it fits on) Place lettuce leaves in the bottom (so the zukes 
don't burn) of a large pot (the biggest you have) and put the zukes in 
Bottom down (if you have enough room; if not, put in howeve they will fit 
and try to secure in place by wedging potatoes or whateverto keep in place. 

Cover with water or brothWELL SALTED- VERY IMPORTANT- MAY BE ADD MORE!) 
and add the rest of the small can of tomato paste and a chopped onion and 
some garlic, cumin whatever and coover with lid and cook about 45min-l 
hour on medium highish till boilin and then reduce to medium/low ish so it 
is simmering. After the hour check a zuke to see if the rice is done. . . if 
it is then you are done. Remove the zukes onto a serving platter and spoon 
a little liquid over them. (discard lettuce and whatever else) You can 
ccover with a onion-mint yohurt sauce and garnish with a sprinkle of 
paprika for color. Yum!

in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. 4 servings. 

I got this out of the local newspaper - I usually use about double the 
amount of cheese called for. Also, depending on what you call medium 
zucchini I found that this recipe is prettty much 4 servings of a main 
dish and halving the recipe works as a side dish. Enjoy!

Ingredients : 



4-5 medium size zuccini, cut in 1/4 in. disks 

3-4 medium potatoes, cut in 1/4 in. disks 

1-2 medium onions, sliced in thick rings 

1-2 medium tomatoes, sliced in 1/4 in. disks

1/2 cup olive oil (or any other oil) 

1/2 cup chopped parsley 

2 tblsp oregano (save for the end!) 



salt and pepper 
Instructions : 



Arrange in loose layers in the baking tray. Try and keep the onion 
rings at the bottom of the pan, they get nice and crispy, and the 
tomatoes go at the top of the assembly, to let the juices drain down 
onto the veggoes . 

Bake for about 1 hour, at medium oven. The oregano should be added a 
few minutes before taking the tray out of the oven - burnt oregano loses 
its flavour, and has a bitter taste. Allow to cool before eating.

ZUCCHINI PARMIGIAN 



Ingredients : 



3 or 4 large zucchinis sliced about 1/4 inch thick 

Lots of olive oil 

Italian seasoned bread crumbs 

6-7 eggs scrambled 

1 cup flour 

2-3 cups shredded mozzerella 

1/2 cup parmesean cheese 



Instructions : 



Take zucchini slices and dredge through flour, egg and bread crumbs. 
When fully coated fry them in a heavy pan with olive oil (about a 1/4 
inch deep) Until browned and very tender. You may have to change oil 
after about 10 slices otherwise it starts smoking and you end up with 
nasty burnt tasting zucchini. 

After all has been fried, coat a lasagne pan with a small amt of sauce 
then layer it such: zucchini, sauce, mozzerella. Repeat. Last layer 
should be both cheeses. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in fridge for 
about 3 to 4 hours to let flavors marry. 

Then take wrap off and cover with foil and bake for 35 to 40 min at 
350 f.

4 large cloves garlic 

wee bit olive oil 

pinch each of dried thyme, marjoram and basil 

3 cups water. 

8 canned (not marinated) artichoke hearts 



Instructions : 



Rinse rice several times, until rinse water runs clear. Saute garlic 
and herbs in olive oil until fragrant, about two minutes, being ultra 
careful not to scorch the garlic. Add rice and saute andother two or 
three minutes. Add artichoke hearts and saute another minute. Add

EGGPLANT FANS 



Ingredients : 



3 medium sized eggplants, ends trimmed 

2 large, firm tomatores, halved lengthwise, cored and thinly sliced 

1/3-1/2 cup olive oil (75 to 125 ml) 

1 large onion, finely chopped 

4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 
4 tender artichokes 

1/2 cup small pitted black olives, rinsed (125 ml) 

2 bay leaves, crumbled 

1 tsp mixed dried thyme, oregano and savory (5 ml) 



Salt and pepper 
Instructions : 



Split the eggplants lengthwise. Place the halves, split side down, on a 
chopping board, and cut each half lengthwise into 1/2 inch (1 cm) 
thicknesses, leaving the slices attached at the stem end to form fans. 
Slip tomato slices into the slits of the eggplant halves. Oil a large 
gratin dish with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the olive oil, and scatter 
half the onion and garlic over the bottom. Arrange the eggplant halves, 
gently forced together, side by side in the dish. 

Pour the remaining olive oil into a bowl. Pare the artichokes to the 
hearts and quarter them, removing the chokes; place the hearts 
immediately into the oil, turning them around to coat them completely 
and protect them from contact with air. Force the quartered artichoke 
hearts and the olives into the crevices around the eggplant fans. Fit 
in the bay leaf fragments here and there, scatter the remaining onion 
and garlic over the surface, and sprinkle with the herbs, salt and 
pepper. Press everything into place to form as regular a surface as 
possible. Dribble the oil left over from the artichokes over the entire 
surface, adding a bit more if necessary. Place a sheet of aluminum foil 
loosely over the surface and bake for about 1 1/2 hours, starting with a 
very hot oven, preheated to 450F (230C) , and turning the heat down to 
about 350F (180C) after 10 minutes or so. 

When done, the stem ends of the eggplants should be soft to the touch. 
Sierve as an hors d'oeuvre, at room temperature.

NUKED ARTICHOKES 



Instructions : 



Take an unt rimmed artichoke and wash it out by running water through it 
and shaking it out a few times. Cut the stem back to about 1 cm below 
the base — you don't want to trim as much as you would if you were 
steaming. Leave the outer leaves and tops on. 

Put one choke in a container, base down. I just use the plastic bag I 
brought it in. Nuke on high for 4 minutes [your milage may vary], maybe 
turning it if your microslave is uneven. Maybe let it sit a while to 
steam a bit more. Now throw away about one or two layers of leaves and 
eat the rest. For guests, you could trim the top now, and if you 
suspect that any bitter bits are left in the stem, trim that as well.

1/4 cup cut up onion slices 

8 ounces marinated artichoke hearts, drained & chopped 

2 Tablespoons sliced black olives

a big one you can do it like this & have people cut off a slice or make 
little ones) . 

Place pastry on a lightly greased cookie sheet. 

When you defrost shells don't let them get too soft - just so they are 
still chilled. 

Combine the next 4 ingredients & place in center of pastry leaving a 1" 
border along the edge. (you can also add some garlic to the mixture)

SHRIMP-STUFFED ARTICHOKES 



Ingredients : 



6 medium artichokes 

1 1/2 lb raw small chrimp 

8 tblsp lemon juice 

4 3/4 tsp salt 

1/2 tsp tarragon 

1/4 tsp ground black pepper 

1 cup mayonnaise 

Instructions : 



To prepare the artichokes, remove the stems, cut one-half inch off the 
tops and snip off the sharp tips of each leaf. Then cook, tightly 
covered, in plenty of boiling water to which you have added two 
tablespoons of the lemon juice and two teaspoons of salt, until the base 
can be pierced wtih a fork, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain well. 

To cook shrimp, bring one quart water to a boil, add one tablespoon 
lemon juice and two teaspoons salt. Add shrimp and bring the water to a 
boil again. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, three to five minutes or 
until shrimp have turned pink. Reserve one-half cup of the water the 
shrimp were cooked in. Then drain, peel and clean the shrimp. Reserve 
18 shrimp for garnish. Place remaining shrimp in a blender with the 
reserved liquid, the remaining five tablespoons of lemon juice, 
seasonings, including the remaining three-quarter teaspoon of salt, and 



http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/artichoke-coll.html (6 of 8) [12/17/1999 12:12:57 PM] 



Artichokes : COLLECTION 

one cup of mayonnaise. Blend until the shrimp are broken up. Chill the 
mixture in the refrigerator, where it will become considerably thicker, 
until ready to fill artichokes. 

Note : 



To insure that this dish looks as attractive as it should, you must 
remove the chokes of the artichokes very carefully. After you have 
spread out the center leaves, pull out the very innermost ones — they 
will be pale in color and rather thorny — then scrape away the fuzzy 
choke with a spoon. If it doesn't come easily, cut around it with a 
grapefruit knife. Don't overcook the artichoke lest it fall apart when 
you handle it .

Two Beet Recipes 

Two Beet Recipes 



From: jgenyuk@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Julia V Genyuk) 
Date: 12 Aug 1993 16:55:39 GMT 

Here are two Russian beet recipes (I'm not sure, that their 
origin is in Russia, but they are pretty popular there) 
All quantities are approximate. 

Vinegret (Beet Salad) 

Boil a couple average beet roots, potatoes and carrots. 
Peel them and cut in small cubes. Cut finely 1 raw onion (you 
may soak it in cold water for a while before this, if you 
want less sharp taste) . Cut into cubes 1-2 sweet pickles. 
Mix everything together and add olive oil. Add also a little 
bit of salt and vinegar to your taste. 

Svekolnik (Beet Soup) Perfect for hot weather! 

You will need a bunch of beets *with greens* for this soup. 
Peel the beet roots and boil until almost done. (You may add 
some vinegar or lemon acid to the water, to make color more deep) . 
Add chopped beet greens and continue boiling until greens are soft. 
Shred beet roots (not too finely) , cool down the soup and put in the 
refrigerator. Boil 1-2 eggs, cut them and a cucumber into small pieces, 
mix and store separately. Serve cold. Before serving, add eggs and cucumber 
to the soup (as much as you like; for me 2 eggs make 3-4 servings) . 
Add also some plain yogurt or light sour cream to your taste 
(In Russia we use kefir; I saw it in health food stores, but never 
tasted, so I don't know if it's the same) . It might be possible to 
use something non-dairy instead, I never tried. 

Enjoy !

Beet Recipe 

From: ida@arezzo.ATC. Olivetti. Com (Ida Meomartino) 
Date: 13 Aug 1993 23:54:27 GMT 

Take the beets (3 or 4) and just cut their leaves. 

Then wash them and put in a pan. (An old one would be fine) 

Finally broil or bake in the oven (eletrical or gas oven, don't use 

a microwave) for about 2 hours at 400 degrees. 

After the cooking, clean them pulling up the skin (like a boiled potato) 
cut in litle stripes or litle pieces and dress with salt, vinegar and oil. 
That ' s it . 

Let me know if you like it. 

I was forgetting to tell you that you can keep the leftovers into refrigerator.

Boston Baked Beans 

Boston Baked Beans 

From: "Kathy Klipec Crow" klipec@ee.Princeton.EDU 
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 93 15:39:02 EDT 

I saw a request for Boston Baked Beans a little while 
back. This is the recipe my mom has used for years. 
Note that this is one dish that is often even better 
as leftovers than the first time around! 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS 

1 pound pea or navy beans 
water 

2 tsp. dry mustard 
pepper 

1 tsp. salt 

3 onions, quartered 
1/4 cup brown sugar 
1/4 cup molasses 

2 Tbsp. sweet pickle juice 

or 2 Tbsp. vinegar with 1/8 tsp. each of ground cinnamon and cloves 
1/4 pound salt pork 

Pick over beans and wash. Cover with 3 cups of water and soak 8 hours or 
overnight. Then add 2 cups of water, mustard, 1/4 tsp. pepper and next 5 
ingredients. Boil, covered, about 1 hour or until skins start to wrinkle. 
Start heating oven to 250 degrees F. Cut salt pork into cubes and place 
beans over pork in beanpot . Sprinkle with pepper and bake 6-8 hours or 
until tender. When beans are two-thirds baked, add about 3/4 cup water or 
just enough to cover. Uncover last half hour. 

VARIATION: All of the cooking can be accomplished in an electric cooker, 
for those who don't want to leave an oven unattended all day. This is how 
my mom generally does it.

ELLIOT, Rose (1979) _The Bean Book_ (Fontana/Collins ) . Pp. 125-126 
[11th impression 1985] 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS - Serves 4 

12 oz. (350 g) haricot beans 
1 large onion 
1 tablespoon oil 

1 teaspoon dry mustard 

2 teaspoons black treacle [I've heard that some yanks use molasses] 
1/4 pint (150 ml) tomato juice (or the liquid from a can of tomatoes) 
2 tablespoons tomato puree 

2 teaspoons brown sugar (presumably the *really* brown, not raw?) 
1/2 pint (275 ml) [not my conversions :)] unsalted stock 

Soak, drain and rinse the beans, then cook them in fresh water until they 
are almost tender, and drain them again. 

Set the oven to 275 F (140 C) , mark 1. Peel and slice the onion. Heat the 
oil in a flameproof casserole and fry the onion for about 5 minutes, 
then add the rest of the ingredients and bring the mixture up to the boil. 
Cover the casserole and put it into the oven; cook for about 4 hours, 
stirring occasionally. "These beans are lovely served with hunks of hot 
whitewheat bread, or garlic bread." 

(This recipe immediately precedes the one for "Continental Lentil 
Toad-in-the-Hole, but I don't know if that is significant ;-)

Date: 29 Sep 1993 15:45:07 GMT 

well i don't use brown sugar but here's what i use. 
I usually measure by eye and taste 

real butter, white sugar, cinnemon, nutmeg and about 
a tsp of vanilla flavoring. 

peel and cut sweet potatos or yams put in pot cover half way with water 
add sugar to taste, about a tsp of cinnemon, nutmeg, vanilla flavoring 
and butter, boil until tender about 30mins ( maybe less) then you transfer 
to a baking dish with a little juice sprinkle with marshmellow and bake 
until marshmellows melt. I usually skip the marshmellows and we eat them 
after they are boiled.

1/2 cup carrots, thinly sliced 
1 cup onions, thinly sliced 
parsley sprigs 
1 bay leaf 
6 peppercorns 

10 juniper berries (or 1/4 cup gin) 

1 1/2 cups beef bouillon

1 cup dry white wine 

salt 

1 2 to 3 pound smoked pork butt

cook, covered, for 4 hours. Check now and then to be sure the 
sauerkraut is not too dry. If all the liquid has cooked away, add a

butt in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the 
heat and simmer, covered, two hours. Start the sausages one hour 
before serving time. Place the kielbasa in a large pot with cold

Crispy Eggplant Rounds 

Crispy Eggplant Rounds 

From: natalie@meaddata.com (Natalie Adams Bendure) 
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 93 14:50:51 EDT 

(Adapted without permission from "Fresh Ways with Italian Cooking") 

2 eggs, slightly beaten (I use just the whites for less fat & calories) 
about 3/4 to 1 cup "Italian Style" Breadcrumbs (Breadcrumbs with a little 

basil, oregano, & parmesean 
cheese mixed in) 

1 lb. of eggplant 
1 tsp. of olive oil 

Wash eggplant, remove top(s), and slice in 1/2 inch thick rounds. Spread the 
olive oil on a cookie sheet. Put the breadcrumbs in one bowl, and the eggs in 
another bowl. Dip the slices first into the eggs, allowing the excess to drip 
off back into the bowl, and then dip both sides into the breadcrumbs. Place on 
cookie sheet. Bake in 425 degree (F) oven for about 15 minutes, turn, and bake 
another 10 minutes, or until desired crispness. 

(Just tried this last night, and it was excellent! Like eating "fried" 
appetizers without the fat and calories ! ! )

BABA GHANOUSH / EGGPLANT WITH TAHINI 



Ingredients : 

3 large eggplants 

2-4 cloves garlic, or to taste 
Salt 

1/2 cup tahini or less, depending on size of eggplants 

juice of 3 lemons, or more to taste 

1/2 tsp ground cumin (optional) 

2 tblsp finely chopped parsley 

A few black olives or 1 tomato, thinly sliced, to garnish 
Instructions :

Eggplant Recipes : COLLECTION 

Cook the eggplants over charcoal or under a gas or electric broiler 
(sear until skins are black and start to blister with the flesh soft and 
juicy, rub skins off under cold water taking care to remove any charred 
particles, then gently squeeze out as much of the bitter juice as 
possible) . 

Crush the garlic cloves with salt. Mash the eggplants with a potato 
masher or fork, then add the crushed garlic and a little more salt, and 
pound to a smooth, creamy puree. Alternatively, use an electric blender 
to make the puree. 

Add the tahini and lemon juice alternatively, beating well or blending 
for a few seconds between each addition. Taste and add more salt, lemon 
juice, garlic, or tahini if you think it is necessary, and if you like, 
a little cumin. 

Pour the cream into a bowl or a few smaller serving dishes. Garnish 
with finely chopped parsley and black olives, or with a few tomato 
slices. Serve as an appetizer with Arab or other bread, as a salad, or 
as a party dip.

BAIGAN BHARTA (MASHED EGG-PLANT) 



Cooking the eggplant : 



Poke the eggplants (say 2, medium sized ones) with a knife, and insert 
slivers of garlic in the slits. The eggplant can be roasted either in a 
conv. oven, a microwave, or ideally, on a slow charcoal grill. When 
they are done (they become kinda' limp), peel, and mash up the insides. 
Use a knife to cut up the long fibres. 

Seasoning : 



In a wok, heat some oil, and add chopped onions, and chopped ginger. 
Fry till the onions are semi-browned, and then add the mashed eggplant. 
Add salt, and pepper to taste. Season with lots of chopped cilantro 
(coriander leaves) . Since the eggplant is already cooked, you need not 
cook for long in the wok. . . just long enough to mix things up good. A 
tomato or two chopped fine, and added with the eggplant also tastes 
good .

Chop onions, ginger, tomatoes, and cilantro, and mix *cold* with the 
mashed eggplant, and a few table spoons of mustard oil. The mustard oil 
gives a nice tangy taste. Look for mustard oil in your nearest Indian 
grocery store. (Salt and pepper too.)

BENGALI EGGPLANT AND YOGURT WITH MUSTARD SEED 



Ingredients : 



1 large eggplant — 1 to 1 1/2 lb, tip cut off and cut into 1" cubes 

1 1/2 tblsp black mustard seeds, powdered in a coffee grinder 

1 cup+ water 

1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 

4-5 tblsp mustard oil 

1 tblsp panch pharon mix (equal parts of whole cumin, fennel, 

fenugreek, mustard, kalunji seeds) 
1 cup yogurt 
1 1/2 tsp salt 

sprinkle black pepper, cardamon powder (optional) 



Instructions : 



Soak ground mustard seed and cayenne in one cup of water. Cut up 
eggplant into cubes. Heat mustard oil, put in panch pharon mix and 
after a few seconds add the black mustard/cayenne water. This will 
splatter so have a cover ready. Add eggplant and cook. You will 
probably need to add additional water as the eggplant cooks to keep its 
level about the same, perhaps another cup. Cover it for the last ten 
minutes . 



When the eggplant is cooked add a cup of yogurt and the salt, mix and 
heat up yogurt, but do not boil. 

Sprinkle a tiny bit of black pepper and cardamon over the top if you 
want . 



This dish also tastes good cold the next day.

BENGAN BARTHA 



Bake an eggplant in an oven 400 deg C for 30 to 40 minutes till it's 
cooked right through and no hard portions remain. It should be cooked 
to the core. The eggplant should be turned a few times so it cooks 
evenly on each side and the skin does not blister. When it's done it'll 
shrivel up a bit . 



Bake 3 large tomatoes for 20 minutes at 350 deg C. till they cook right 
through . 

In a deep pan heat a little mustard oil. Drop in a table spoonful of 
minced garlic and a table spoonful of minced ginger. Add a few thinly 
diced hot green chillies. Stir for a minute or so till the mix. is 
lightly browned. Now add in the cooked eggplant and tomatoes. Using a 
spatula crush the eggplant and tomatoes very well till they mix 
thoroughly. Simmer on low for 10 minutes. Add salt to your liking and 
add some chopped green coriander to the dish and stir. 

The dish is ready to eat. It's eaten with Daal and Rice but I just eat 
it with hot rice. Enjoy and thank me.

EGGPLANT FANS 



Ingredients : 



3 medium sized eggplants, ends trimmed

gratin dish with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the olive oil, and scatter 
half the onion and garlic over the bottom. Arrange the eggplant halves, 
gently forced together, side by side in the dish. 

Pour the remaining olive oil into a bowl. Pare the artichokes to the 
hearts and quarter them, removing the chokes; place the hearts 
immediately into the oil, turning them around to coat them completely 
and protect them from contact with air. Force the quartered artichoke 
hearts and the olives into the crevices around the eggplant fans. Fit 
in the bay leaf fragments here and there, scatter the remaining onion 
and garlic over the surface, and sprinkle with the herbs, salt and 
pepper. Press everything into place to form as regular a surface as 
possible. Dribble the oil left over from the artichokes over the entire 
surface, adding a bit more if necessary. Place a sheet of aluminum foil 
loosely over the surface and bake for about 1 1/2 hours, starting with a 
very hot oven, preheated to 450F (230C) , and turning the heat down to 
about 350F (180C) after 10 minutes or so. 

When done, the stem ends of the eggplants should be soft to the touch. 
Sierve as an hors d'oeuvre, at room temperature.

3 fresh thyme sprigs, chopped fine

12 



fresh oregano sprigs, chopped fine 
fresh basil sprigs, chopped fine 
chicken broth 
bay leaf, crumbled 

1/4-inch-thick slices of French bread, toasted 
goat's milk mozzarella, grated coarsely 



Instructions : 



In a bowl coat the eggplant and the bell pepper lightly with 1 
tablespoon of the oil and season the vegetables with salt and pepper. 
In a foil-lined roasting pan arrange the eggplant, skin sides down, the 
bell pepper, skin sides up, the onions, cut sides down, and the 
tomatoes, cut sides down, and roast the vegetables in the upper third of 
a pre-heated 400degree F. oven for 10 minutes. Put the garlic in the 
pan near the tomatoes, roast the vegetables for 30 to 40 minutes more, 
or until the bell pepper is charred, and let them cool. Remove the skin 
from the bell pepper and the onions and coarsely chop the eggplant, the 
bell pepper, the onions, and the garlic. 

In a large kettle melt the butter with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil 
over moderately high heat, add the chopped vegetables including the 
garlic, the tomatoes, the thyme, the oregano, the basil, and enough of 
the broth to just cover the mixture, and bring the mixture to a boil. 
Add the bay leaf and simmer the soup for 30 minutes, or until it is 
thickened slightly. In a blender or food processor puree the soup in 
batches, transferring it as it is pureed to the cleaned kettle (the soup 
will be thick and textured, flecked with black bits of the eggplant), 
and heat it with the remaining broth over moderately low heat until it 
is heated through. 

Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet, sprinkle them with 
mozzarella, and broil the croutons under a preheated broiler about 4 
inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cheese is golden. 
Ladle the soup into 6 bowls and top each serving with 2 croutons. 
Serves 6. 

(Also, instead of full slices as croutons, after broiling, with a sharp 
knife the toasted bread can be cut into smaller croutons and sprinkled 
onto the soup)

Felafel (1) 

Felafel (1) 

From: hammond@odin.scd.ucar.edu (Steve Hammond) 
Date: Thu, 15 Jul 1993 17:22:50 GMT 

This recipe is from page 140 of the Moosewood Cookbook, by M. Katzen 

1 have made it many times and the felafel are great. 

4 cups cooked chickpeas (2cups, soaked 1.5 hours, boiled until very soft) 

2 beaten eggs 

3 cloves garlic (crushed) 

1/2 cup *each*, finely minced, celery and scallions 
1/2 tsp ground cumin 
3 Tbs tahini 
1/2 tsp tumeric 
3 Tbs flour 

1/4 tsp cayenne, dash black pepper 
1.5 tsp salt 

Mash chickpeas well (make sure they are cooked well enough to be mashable) . 
Combine with other ingredients. Chill well. 

With floured hands, make the batter into one-inch-diameter balls. 
Dust each one lightly with flour. 

Heat a two inch pool of oil in heavy skillet to 365 degrees. 
Deep fry felafel until golden brown, serve immediately. 

My Modifications: 

I usually use 1-2 tsp of cayenne because I like them spicy. 
I usually heat the oil in my wok and then drop the batter into the wok 
by spoonfuls. Don't put too many in the wok at a time or the temp, 
will drop. 

I peel, seed and slice cucumber, cube tomato and grab a bunch of 
alfalfa sprouts and tuck them into a pita with some ranch dressing

Fried Plantains 

Fried Plantains 

From: Nancy Whitney 

Date: M on, 1 Nov 93 9:47:47 EST 

This is an easy and tasy way of preparing plantains; 

2 Pantains 
Oil for frying 

Cut plantains into about 1/2 inch slices. Fry for several minutes in 
hot oil, until slices begin to turn golden (not too dark), and they are 
beginning to get tender. They do not need to be really soft at this 
point . 

Take slices out of oil and drain on a paper towel. Move to a sturdy 
surface like a cutting board, and smash the slices down with the bottom 
of a cup (like a juice glass or some such) . The point is to make them 
smash down to about 1/2 their original height, not to get them really 
thin . 

Throw back into hot oil and fry again, until they get more tender, maybe 
1-2 minutes on each side. Take out of oil, drain, sprinkle with salt and 
server in place of potatos .

Lentils 

Lentils 

From: kasserra@helix.nih.gov (Claudia Kasserra) 
Da t e : Sun, 14 N ov 1993 12:33:02 -0500 

Someone asked for lentil recipes. This is my mothers recipe, I can never 
get enough of it. Its fast and inexpensive. 

-approx. 4 cups lentils 
-4 slices bacon 

-Polish sausage (or Farmer's etc.) 
-1 large onion, chopped 
-1 bag carrots, chopped 
- 2-4 bouillon cubes 
-1/2 cup vinegar 

Saute onion and chopped bacon in oil. I like to do this in a pressure 
cooker, you will know the reason in a moment. Add chopped sausage, lentils, 
bouillon cubes, and about six cups of water. Heat mixture thoroughly, 
stirring occasionally, adding water as the lentils soak it up so that you 
have a stew consistency. Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar and cook for about 1 
hour. This is where the pressure cooker comes in. If you don't have one, 
you'll have to continue cooking until the lentils are soft, about 21/2 hrs . 
If you do have a pressure cooker, after the 1 hr regular cooking, pressure 
cook the mixture for about 15 min . Season to taste with salt, pepper and 
the rest of the vinegar. Oops, add the carrots after 1 hr of cooking. 
Terrific on a cold night!

Curing Olives 

Curing Olives 

From: marple@cs.ubc.ca (Kirk Marple) 
Date: 14 Jul 1993 17:56:41 -0700 



These instructions for curing olives are from _The Food of Greece_ by 
Vilma Liacouras Chantiles (Simon & Schuster, 1975) : 

Collect the olives as ripe as possible (late November in Greece) . 
Slash or stamp each olive with the side of knife or board to make an 
opening, then soak in cold water in earthenware or glass containers 
for 10 days, changing the water daily. Soak in a brine solution for 24 
hours, then wash off the brine and soak for 24 hours in vinegar. 
Drain. Store in jars in olive oil. This method will preserve olives 
indefinitely. (If sourer olives are preferred, add a little vinegar to 
the oil) .

Red Beans and Rice - Collection 



Red Beans and Rice #4 

( Shane's 40 min variety ) 

2 cans Red Beans ( black-eyed peas also work ) 

1/2 pound smoked sausage ( the smokier the better ) 

1 medium to large onion, chopped 

1/2 bell pepper, chopped ( too much will make it bitter ) 

2 green onions ( if you have them ) 

1 rib of celery, chopped ( if you have it ) 

1 tsp minced garlic ( I usually get it in the little jar ) 

salt, pepper, red pepper, tabasco (or just Tony's if you have it) 

thyme and parsley ( if you have them ) 

a little beer ( if you're drinking one or have one handy ) 
a little vegetable oil 
uncooked rice 

Rinse out the Red beans in their cans and fill the cans with 
water, set aside. Chop up all that needs to be chopped up 
( including sausage ) and get out your trusty deep black iron 
skillet or pot. Put enough oil to wet the bottom of the pot 
and start frying the sausage. After about a 1 min or so, 
season the sausage really well with the salt and pepper ( 
esp pepper ) . When the sausage is about 1/2 done, stir in the 
onions, bell pepper, and celery. Stir fry it all until the 
sausage is done and the vegetables are limp. ( push the 
sausage to the side of the skillet if it cooks too fast and 
focus on the vegetables ) . Pour in the beans and water, and 
add about another can of water ( cover all the contents and 
leave burner at frying setting ) . Add the garlic, a few 
shakes of tabasco, a little ( about 2 tablespoons ) beer, a 
pinch of thyme, and about 1/4 cup parsley. While the 
mixture comes to a boil, start the rice on another burner. 
Keep the Red beans at a raging simmer, and stir often. When 
the rice is done, the beans should be about done. Cook the 
beans down to the desired consistancy, and squash a few beans 
on the bottom for a more paste like texture. Serve beans 
over rice with a little more pepper sprinkled on top. 
Serves 3. 

RED BEANS AND RICE #5 



1 pound of small red beans 

1/2 pound of ham hocks or smoked hocks (optional) (can substitute polish 

sausage, if you want) 
1 large yellow onion, peeled and chopped 
3 stalks celery, chopped

Red Beans and Rice - Collection 



1 Tablespoon parsley 
1/2 green pepper, chopped 
1-2 bay leaves 

2 large cloves garlic, crushed 
1/8 pound margarine 

Pepper to taste 
1 Tablespoon Worchestershire sauce 
Tabasco to taste 
Salt to taste 

3 cups cooked white rice 

Soak beans overnight in ample water. The next day, drain the water 
from the beans, and place in a heavy kettle. Add the ham, onion, 
celery, parsley, bay leaves, and garlic, and add water to the pot 
barely to cover the contents. Bring to a boil, and then turn to a 
simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours, being careful that the beans 
do not stick or become too dry. You may have to add a little water. 

After the initial two hours of cooking, add the margarine, pepper, 
Worchestershire, and Tabasco to the pot. Continue cooking for 1 more 
hour, this time with a lid on the pot and the heat quite low. 

Correct the seasonings. You may wich to add a bit of salt, but do not 
add salt until this point because salt cooks out of the ham (if 
present) and will season the beans. 

Serve over white rice. Pass additional Tabasco sauce for the brave!

Red Kale with Grated Coconut 

Red Kale with Grated Coconut 

From: Nita Goyal nita@CS.Stanford.EDU 
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 93 13:07:59-0700 

This is a recipe for Red kale that I got from a friend. I am sending 
it without her permission but I am sure she will be happy to share it. 
The recipe comes from the Kerala region of India (south western 
coastal area) . You might want to reduce the amount of green chillies! 

(obtained from Anna Verghese) 

(Can sometimes call it 'thoran' , but grandma may protest:-)) 

Kale :This is a leafy vegetable like "Cheera" . You get two varieties 
in the grocery stores. I prefer red one to the green one. 
you can try the green one too. 

Ingredients : 

Kale : One bunch - chopped fine. 

Shallots : one.- chopped fine. (This is the small ulli we get in Kerala. 

Here it is not small:-)) . Available in grocery stores. 
Garlic : one or two ( paste half a teaspoon) - chopped fine 
ginger : half an inch cube - chopped fine 
Green chillies : 3 to 4 chopped. 
Coconut powder : 3 table spoons. 
Onion : Half - chopped fine, 
oil : 2 to 3 teaspoons, 
salt : one teaspoon 
Mustard seeds : One teaspoon. 
Turmeric powder : Quarter teaspoon 
Cumin seeds : a pinch 

Procedure : 

Heat oil in a shallow vessel. ( preferably Non-stick) 

Put mustard seeds and then shallots. 

When shallots start turning brown, mix the kale . 

Then put the onions, ginger, garlic, salt, cumin seeds, 

coconut powder, and turmeric powder. 

Mix it well and keep the vessel open. 

Stir it occassionally till it is fully dry. 

Note : 

1. Those who do not like coconut can avoid it. 

2. Those who can get hold of a grinder can mix the onions, garlic, ginger, 
coconut, cumin seeds, and turmeric in it.

Spaghetti Squash 

Spaghetti Squash 

From: marcia@netcom.com (Marcia) 
Date: Mon, 11 Oct 1993 22:52:06 G MT 

My favorite way to prepare spaghetti squash is: boil/bake until soft, 
separate strands. Drain if you boiled it. Add about a cup of grated cheese, 
basil, and margarine. Toss. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Yum .

Spiced Acorn Squash 

From: marie@ai.mit.edu (Marie Lamb) 
D a t e : 18 N ov 1993 19:11:49 GMT 

Just in time for Turkey Day, my favorite squash recipe: 

6 whole acorn squash 
3/4 tsp. cinnamon 
3/4 tsp. ginger 
3/4 tsp. mace 

6 Tbs . butter or margarine, melted 
1 Tbs . cider vinegar 
6 Tbs. maple syrup** 

Preheat oven to 350F. Split each squash in half lengthwise; scoop 
out and discard seeds and fiber from centers. Slice a thin piece 
from each bottom so they will rest flat in the pan. Place squash 
in a shallow baking dish. Mix spices together and sprinkle over 
squash. Mix melted butter with vinegar; drizzle over squash. 
Add 1/2 Tbs. maple syrup to each cavity. Cover dish with foil 
and bake for 1 and 3/4 hours. Remove foil; baste. Return to oven 
for 10 minutes. Serves 12. 

**If you can't get maple syrup in your area, you can substitute 
pancake syrup, or sprinkle the squash with brown sugar before drizzling 
with the butter mixture.

COLACHE 

(Serves 6-7) 

Ingredients : 



2 tblsp vegetable oil 

1 Butternut Squash OR small Pumpkin (about 2 lbs) peeled, seeded, 
and diced 

1 medium onion, coarsley chopped 

1 clove garlic, minced 

16 oz canned tomatoes, undrained 

1 green pepper, seeded, cut into 1" cubes 

14 oz can whole kernal corn 

1 green chili, coarsley chopped (optional) 

1/2 tsp salt 

1/4 tsp pepper 



Instructions : 



http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/squash-coll.html (1 of 7) [12/17/1999 12:14:06 PM] 



Squash Recipes : COLLECTION 

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add squash, onion, and 
garlic; cook for 5 minutes or until onion is tender. 

Coarsley chop tomatoes; add tomatoes and bell pepper to skillet. Bring 
to a boil over high heat. cover; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. 

Add remaining ingredients. Simmer covered, 5 minutes or until squash is 
tender. Uncover; increase heat to high. Continue cooking a few minutes 
or until most liquid has evaporated. 



Pumpkin is the traditional squash used in this dish, but butternut is 
less stringy and easier to cut an peel. 



I used butternut, and it was yummy. Also used more garlic. It took me 
a bit longer to cook than the recipe indicates. I didn't have whole 
tomates, but crushed which probably made a liquid difference. My squash 
may have been cubed a bit big, too. So if you dish is taking long, I 
suggest adding the green pepper late in the stage for it to retain color 
better. This is a very attractive dish. I would also suggest using 
fresh or frozen corn instead of canned for appearance and taste.

Squash Recipes : COLLECTION 

Instructions : 



There are two parts to the preparation. I start with the Kofta 
(vegetable) balls. While baking (or deep fry if you like grease) the 
Kofta balls, prepare the Malai (Hindi for "cream") sauce. 

Heat oven to 425 or so. In large bowl, grate the squashes and onion, 
add spices, add optional egg. 

Mix chickpea flour till breaddough consistency. Form kofta "dough" into 
1 inch diameter balls. Place on cookie sheet, bake for 25 minutes or 
so . 

While cooking: Mix Malai sauce. 
Malai Sauce: 



4 large tomatoes 

1 hot chili ( serrano or Jap) . Remove seeds if wimpy. 
1.5 inch fresh ginger, or full teaspoon powdered. 

2 cups cream 



Puree above in blender. 



Heat 4 tablespoons peanut oil in saucepan. 
Mix : 

2 tsp ground Cumin 
3/4 tsp Turmeric 
2 tsp Garam Masala 
2 tsp Paprika 

Add the above spices all at once to hot oil for 1 minute. Add tomato (e) 
puree to spices. Add 1 more cup cream to spices and the puree. Boil. 

Reduce heat, simmer for 10 minutes. Add half of the cooked Kofta balls. 
Simmer another 10 to soften them. 

Serve with brown rice, chapatis, vinegar soaked onions and chilies . 
Heuristics : 



1) Slightly wet hands when forming Kofta balls. 

2) Freeze other half of Kofta balls and use with next batch of Malai 
to save time.

Squash Recipes : COLLECTION 



3) Keep Kofta balls seperate from Malai sauce till needed. (They absorb 
the liquid from sauce) 

4) Milk can be substituted for some of the cream. Have not tried soy 
milk . 

5) Add 1 drop red and 1 drop yellow food coloring to vinegar to make 
reasonably authentic orange onions (a la Akbar's)

SQUASH RECIPES 



Acorn, butternut, bannana, spaghetti etc squash are great if you just 
steam them in the microwave until soft, then mash in a little margarine 
and cinnamon. 



I like to take zuchinni, crookneck (yellow), and pattypan (summer) 
squash, and either layer them with a little garlic, black pepper, and 
steam them in the microwave (with a splash of sake for flavor) , or 
sautee them with onions and mushrooms with rosemary and white wine. 
Slice into thin chunks for either. 



Bannana squash also makes a great thickener and sweetener for winter 
vegatable soups (with cabbage, potatoes, onion, turnip, celery, and 
whatever else is in the fridge) . 

You can also slice acorn or butternut squash in half, make a filling of 
some kind of grain or rice with nuts, cheese, sauteed veggies, maybe 
some raisins, then stuff the squash halves and bake at 350 until the 
squash is soft. Be creative.

SQUASH SHELLS 



http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/vegetables/squash-coll.html (6 of 7) [12/17/1999 12:14:07 PM] 



Squash Recipes : COLLECTION 

Ingredients : 



1/2 spaghetti squash per person 

1/4 cup cooked ham chunks per squash half 

1/2 cup cooked peas 

1/2 beaten egg yolk per squash half 

1/4 cup cream per squash half 

1/4 cup Parmesan cheese per squash half 

Instructions : 



Cook and drain the squash. Separate out the spaghetti strands, handling 
the shells carefully so they do not tear. Set the shells aside to 
drain. In a bowl mix together the strands of spaghetti squash with the 
rest of the ingredients. Mound this mixture back into the squash halves 
and microwave or bake until heated through. 

Notes : 



Since I was growing spaghetti squash last year - I planted three which 
was a big mistake - those vines are incredibly prolific - the need to 
find things to do with them turned critical pretty fast. Here is my 
list : 

1. Cooked spaghetti squash has a "noodle-like" quality which makes it a 
good addition to lots of soups. 

2. Eat the seeds. They are great raw and even better dried and lightly 
salted and toasted (similar to pumpkin seeds) . 

3. Eat as a side dish vegetable with appropriate herbs, butter, 
cheese. . . (Incidently, the best way to cook spaghetti squash is in the 
Microwave -1/2 squash, cut lengthwise, covered and vented for about 8 
minutes on Hi) . 

4. I had so much of the stuff around that I got out all my old zuchinni 
recipes and tried using finely chopped spaghetti squash instead of 
zuchinni in all those cake and loaf recipes ... worked like a charm. 

5. Spaghetti squash can be sliced in chunks and eaten raw, either added 
to salads or with a dip.

Sweet Potatoes wtih Grapefruit 

Sweet Potatoes wtih Grapefruit 

From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) 
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 00:37:57 GMT 

13/4 pounds sweet potatoes 

1 large grapefruit 

3 tablespoons unsalted butter 

1/3 cup (firmly packed) light brown sugar 

1/4 teaspoon salt 

2 eggs, well beaten 

Preheat oven to 375F. Put the potatoes, unpeeled, in a large saucepan and 
cover with water. With a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, peel the yellow 
zest from the grapefruit and put it in with the potatoes. Bring to a boil, 
reduce the heat and simmer until the sweet potatoes are just fork-tender, 
about 20 minutes. 

Meanwhile, with a long-pronged fork or tongs, dip the grapefruit into the 
boiling potato water and blanch, turning constantly, for 30 seconds. Rinse 
the grapefruit briefly under cold running water to cool and peel off the 
white pith. Section the grapefruit and peel off the membranes over a bowl 
to catch the juice. Reserve all the juice and pulp; discard any seeds. 

When the sweet potatoes are done, drain and let cool; discard the grapefruit 
zest. Peel the potatoes and put them into a food processor along with the 
grapefruit pulp and juice, the butter, brown sugar and salt. Puree until 
smooth. Add the eggs and mix to blend. 

Pour the sweet potato mixture into a well-buttered, 6-cup souffle dish. 
Place in a pan of hot water and bake for 45 minutes, or until the center 
is set.

Lightly saute the onions in 4 T . of the margarine, and stir in the flour, 
sugar, salt and white pepper. Blend well. Stir in the sour cream. Cook 
until thick, stirring occasionally. Drain the green beans and add to the 
sour cream mixture. Pour into a buttered casserole. Top with swiss 
cheese. Melt the remaining 3 T. of margarine, then stir in the corn 
flakes. Spread over the top of the cheese. 
Bake at 350 F. for 30-40 minutes 

This may be prepared in advance and refrigerated, but it is better if you 
prepare the corn flake mixture when you are ready to bake the dish.
