# **Communication Skills**

### **Presentation planning:**
* Who is your audience?
* Whats the goal? ("to inspire"?)
    * Build a structure (more relevant for teaching)
* Define the problem early
    * rational vs emotional appeal:  
    "Emotions have a grater impact than facts, which is more trustworthy (i.e. objective) and replicable but can be too cold/boring."
* Build relevance early
    * make it palpable / relatable
    * use analogies
    * how is this useful / important
* Call to action (i.e. take-home message)

### **Useful tools:**
#### **A. Story-telling**
* The pyramid principle:  
    * SCQA: Situation > Complication > Question > Answer (they loop into layers)
* Flagging sentences: "this is particularly important"
* Bridging sentences: direct the focus from one place to another

#### **B. Solicit something**
* PREP: Point > Reason > Evidence > Point
    * Flipping: the reason can become the point!

#### **C. Ask for investment**
1. Recommendation
2. problem & opportunity
    - why work on this problem?
    - How big is the problem? (eg. 1 million people...)
    - How big is the opportunity?
3. The vision
4. Why you (me)?
    - how do you differentiate from competitors
5. Plan & Steps (project road-map)
6. Requests
    - not just money, maybe networking or other way of supporting you/project

### **Feedback to me:**
* Face your audience (avoid giving them your back - changing slides)
* Define things (i.e. what i meant by "passive" politics)
* Breath between sentences!! - you were talking a little to fast
* Political sides - try to be more neutral
